rag,PyObject preservation and resurrection for `StorageImpl`,"It may be useful for `StorageImpl` to support PyObject preservation and resurrection. TensorImpl has this behavior. When a reference count to the PyObject for a tensor goes to zero, but its associated TensorImpl is still being used, the ownership is flipped so that the TensorImpl hangs onto the PyObject, preventing it from getting deallocated. If the PyObject ever needs to be resurrected again, ownership is flipped again and the PyObject is given back to Python. The Python object will retain all of the properties it had before, since it was never deallocated. See CC(Preserve PyObject even when it is dead from Python side)  ",2022-12-26T23:08:25Z,module: internals triaged enhancement better-engineering,open,0,18,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/91395,", since it is subtle but can work for any py object, not just in pytorch","Hey  , I'd like to better understand why this will be useful for storages. One possible use case is if someone wants to add a property to an UntypedStorage that remains alive even after all the Python references to it are deleted. Perhaps like this:  You also mentioned that PyObject preservation would allow us to make weakref work properly. In the podcast, you said that this is useful for creating caches that contain nonowning references to the cached objectsif the cache is the only reference to the object, then allow the object to be freed. Another use case is to store private fields for objects in a separate dictionary that is keyed by weak references, rather than attaching properties directly to the object like in the code example above. I can definitely see why someone would want to do these things with tensors. But I don't know how often people use storages in the first place, let alone if people want to use storages in these somewhat obscure ways. If you're sure that this will be useful, then greatI just want to make sure I understand the idea fully","So, this ask is primarily coming from . Let me dig up his use cases. * https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/0b255b3f80d9d365b5f4a064c88278270d6bfac4/torch/_subclasses/meta_utils.pyL147L153 we have to manually detect dead storages and run callbacks on them, because weakrefs don't work. * ""well, i mentioned to Greg wanting to calculate the max batch size symbolically. for that, ideally youd set a cleanup (finalize) function on fake tensors storage to tell you a deallocation has happened""; once again, can't do this because weakref doesn't work * ""similarly, for the cuda graph tapes impl (which we're deferring to post release, so no rush on review there or anything), i want to have a weakref to the tensor storage instead of the tensor itself"" (I'm not exactly sure why but it seems plausible) So this is all mostly about weakrefs. I don't think this feature would be useful for users, it'd mostly be a libraryside usage thing.","Got it, that makes sense, thanks!",I will start with writing the standalone example repo first,"I have a working standalone example repo that shows how PyObject preservation can be implemented: https://github.com/kurtamohler/pyobjectpreservation It still needs polishing and more comments in the code, but I think the main idea is there. Let me know what you think I'll go ahead and start implementing this for storages next","The overall structure looks good, I need to carefully read over MyClassBase.cpp but the broad strokes architecture looks great","There seem to be some errors in MyClassBase.cpp. The one I noticed is you're using shared pointer to point to the C++ type from MyClassBase PyObject. But this is not enough; you need to be able to toggle between owning and not owning from Python to C++, because when the ownership goes from Python to C++, having a shared ptr from C++ to Python means cycle aka you will never deallocate. It looks like the code is a little too much simplified from the conversion from intrusive pointer to shared pointer. I recommend preserving intrusive pointer and then also trying to keep more of the original code structure, including helper functions, e.g.","Thanks for the feedback, I'll make those changes",btw is doing the same thing as https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/81616 also part of this work?,"I'm having some trouble with adding a `PyObjectSlot` member to `c10::StorageImpl`.

yi,Converting booleans into floats does not consistently yield exact 0 or 1," üêõ Describe the bug **Updated**: Problem solved by using `.isclose()` I wrote a function to compute the fullsequence accuracy of predicted sequences against the target sequences. Part of the function looks like the following:  One thing that is puzzling me is that sometimes `abs_correct` will contain all `False` even though most of the values inside `batch_overlap_rate` is 1. I do not know why I got the following. Is it an error?  If I print `batch_overlap_rate` and `batch_overlap_rate2` out, essentially both are a torch.Tensor of `torch.Size([1000])` and consists of lots of 1.0s, but comparing the former with 1.0 yields only `False`. I checked the data types of both variables. Nothing different. The function is fixed, and this issue only occurs **occasionally** but in a very particular way. Only sequences of certain lengths lead to this problem. There are two other metrics inside this function (e.g., overlap rate), their values are always right.  **Updated**: The problem seems to be linked to floating precision. However, the output of `(Y == Ypred).float()` should always be either 0 or 1, right?

finetuning,[FSDP] FSDP with CPU offload consumes `1.65X` more GPU memory when training models with most of the params frozen," üêõ Describe the bug Context: We have more and more situations where a large part of the model that's being trained is frozen. As these are very large LLMs, we want to leverage FSDP with CPU offloading to fit such large model training with only a tiny fraction of training params on consumer GPUs. To this end, below is an example of finetuning `bigscience/mt0small` using LoRA parameter efficient finetuning method with/without FSDP. To finetune with FSDP:  1. Following https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/issues/807, to avoid `AssertionError: expects all parameters to have same requires_grad`, created a custom `auto_wrap_policy` such that the layers with trainable params are in separate FSDP units than those which are frozen. The result model along with FSDP options are given below. We are using Accelerate's FSDP integration . the trainable params have `lora_` prefix:  2. The number of trainable params are given below:  3. Now, the issue is that in comparison to **plain Pytorch**, FSDP consumes **1.65X more GPU memory** instead of reducing the same by a large amount (expectation) while also greatly increasing the memory consumed on CPU. Below are ",2022-12-20T10:49:54Z,high priority triage review oncall: distributed triaged module: fsdp,open,2,20,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/91165,"Thanks for providing so many details! This helps us out a lot. We may need more time to investigate why CPU offload consumes so much more GPU memory. For now, have you guys tried setting `limit_all_gathers=True`? We plan to default to this soon. Without this, the memory usage may be unexpectedly high (as long as the CPU thread runs faster than the GPU execution, which is almost always). This may or may not be related to this issue. IIUC, CPU offload was required for the 1T parameter training run (cc: varma ), so the memory savings were proven there. Conceptually, I am not seeing how frozen parameters/layers affect the GPU memory usage aside from the optimizer state as you mentioned. In that case, if you think it is helpful, could you verify what optimizer states are being created when using FSDP? Are you seeing that optimizer states are being created even for `FlatParameter`s that do not require gradient?","Hello , thanks for your quick reply. Apart from the optimizer states only for only the tiny portion of trainable params, offloading to CPU should further reduce GPU memory usage. In case of CPU offloading, the expected behaviour would be to only move model shards (T5 block one at a time as they belong to separate FSDP units) from CPU to GPU, do the forward pass computation and then GPU to CPU (similar to B/w pass), **hence the max memory consumption on GPU should be that of a single T5 block only**. Let me know if there are gaps in my understanding.", Do you have a recommendation for how to try to reproduce this?," From the source code, it seems that another problem of FSDP is that the freezed parameters are not deallocated until the end of the backward.

transformer,Support arbitrary masks for _nested_tensor_from_mask in nn.TransformerEncoder," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch I am working on transformers and am using the Better Transformer. To enjoy the speed improvement, we need to pass a src_key_padding_mask to the nn.TransformerEncoder.

That is the common case in NLP as sentences have different lengths, but in computer vision, the True values in a mask are usually arbitrarily dispersed.

The errors quickly escalate in my numerical calculations and break down my simulations. Take the following data as an example (I know it is somewhat illconditioned, but the changes in behaviors are real)  With `torch 1.12.1`, the relative errors are around machineprecision (a few 1e16), which is *consistent with the precision obtained from `numpy` or `cupy`*  However, **with `torch 1.13.0`, the relative errors are huge (max at 5e11)**   Below are more comparisons using `torch.float64` and `cuda`  And more comparisons using `torch.float32` and `cpu`   Versions For tests with `torch 1.12.1`, the output is  For tests with `torch 1.13.0`, the output is  ",2022-12-08T06:04:45Z,triaged module: linear algebra,closed,0,11,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/90453,cc:  who is a linalg guru,That matrix is very badly conditioned:  as such errors of that order are expected.

See https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/numerical_accuracy.htmlextremalvaluesinlinalg Yes, they are illconditioned but are helplessly, physically motivated. Do you mind elaborating a bit what have changed in `0.13.0`? Are there some settings that I can use to make `torch` produce results similar to previous versions?  "," I tried to find what have changed in the blog posts but didn't find any clue behind this change of behaviors.  With `torch 1.12.1` or earlier, I can obtain the same answer in my test use cases from either `torch`, `numpy`, or `cupy` (including the example given above). And I've already spent quite some time to adapt my code from using `numpy` to `torch` to take advantage of the GPU acceleration.  Thus, I do wonder if this precision change is somewhat permanent or is there some hope on revival of old behaviors?"," I compiled PyTorch from source and can confirm that the commit 54949a5abc9890143de4b5dd2f13ff98446376a3 is responsible for this behavior change. **Here I want to argue that, even if the matrix is illconditioned, the solution should be around machineprecision** (one may question the correctness of the solution, but that's another issue).  Using `torch` with one commit prior (65a37923f9b14c7c9e80535d771ef9e4e92d0502) gives the expected results  Using `torch` with 54949a5abc9890143de4b5dd2f13ff98446376a3 gives the new results  However, my current knowledge is not enough to understand what had changed in the commit 54949a5abc9890143de4b5dd2f13ff98446376a3. Any ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","That commit is mostly a better engineering commit. Now, it introduces an optimisation. To avoid performing a copy of the matrix `A`, if `A` is Ccontiguous (rowmajor), we factorise `A^T` instead and then call `lu_solve` with `adjoint=True`. It may be the case that the backend library (the relevant BLAS implementation that you use) is a bit less precise when called with `adjoint=True`. In my opinion, errors of that order are reasonable for linear algebra. As discussed in the note linked in  CC(`torch.linalg.solve` yields much lower precisions in `1.13.0` than previous versions)issuecomment, it is expected that different different devices and different backends give marginally different solutions. What I would suggest if you do care about these is that you try to find a small repro in C / C++ and you report the accuracy mismatch to the relevant BLAS implementation that you are using."," Thanks a lot for the explanations. Sorry if I misunderstand something, but I am not using a specific BLAS implementation  the error seems to be quite consistent across *very* different devices/platforms and BLAS backends (`mkl/cuda/generic/open`, see tests below). Is there any way that I may confirm the issue is due to some BLAS implementation? Thanks you again in advance.  **1**. The test results in the first comment of this issue were from **WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04**, a laptop with Intel i711800H + RTX 3070 Mobile, where the `cpu` results used `MKL` and the `cuda` results used (I think) `cuBLAS` (if not, I guess it is something in `MAGMA`). Below shows the config:  **2**. The test results in the sixth comment (where I found the exact commit responsible for this issue) were from a **CentOS 7 server** with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E52650 v2, where I only (compiled and) used `cpu` with `BLAS_INFO=generic` and `USE_MKL=OFF`. Below shows the config:  **3**. On a **MacBook Pro with M1 Pro**, I can also reproduce the errors (from either `torch` installed via `pip` or `torch` compiled by `MacPorts`)  **4**. On a **Ubuntu 20.04 server with ARM NeoverseN1**, I can also reproduce the errors with `OpenBLAS`  **5**. On a CentOS 7.9 server **but with AMD EPYC 7552 + Nvidia Tesla V100SPCIE32GB**, I can also reproduce the errors  I can do more tests on more platforms/backends if necessary (if these turn out to be useful tests).","Thank you for the rather comprehensive dissection! Alas, I still think that this error is coming from the backend implementation. As you can see in that PR, we dispatch to the same backends, only that in the initial PR, when the matrix A is rowmajor, we copied it into a column major matrix (which is slow) and then called the backend `getrs` with `trans='N'`. What that PR introduces is the optimisation of, rather than copying `A` into a columnmajor matrix, we simply call `getrs` with `trans='T`'. This is mathematically equivalent, but it's clear from your experiments that this codepath may not be as numerically stable when called with illconditioned matrices as the `trans='N'` path. Again, here we are simply calling the given backends and perform a semanticpreserving optimisation as per the backend docs. I think this particular discrepancy should be reported to the relevant backends, given that you have a concrete reproducer. Note that having less wellmaintained paths in some of this libraries is not uncommon. We have found during the years many bugs in different libraries. For example, for MAGMA we discovered that the path `trans='T'`in `getrs` was buggy and I had to implement this option in terms of the `trans='N'` option in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/77634/. See in particular https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/983d4f6fbb51381faa4af651f49142f45c834f8d/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/linalg/BatchLinearAlgebra.cppL2460L2462","Yo can also see the bounds in the `getrs` docs about the guarantees given by the CPU backend. Given the condition number of the given matrix, I would not be surprised that the provided solutions are indeed within the range specified there. Now, if you want to recover the previous implementation, what you can do is to bypass the optimisation that that PR added altogether by making the matrix columnmajor as per:  You can see that by doing this you get the same results as with PyTorch 1.12. Now, as in PyTorch 1.12 (before that speed optimisation was implemented, you have to copy the data once.  ",Thank you very much for the explanations and the workaroundüëç!

It throws an error somewhere reported as lying around lines 114345 of the *module.py* buried deep in the anaconda3/lib/ .../sitepackages/ storage, but there is no reference to this ""*aten*"" process anywhere in that file. My supposition is that I have done something stupid/ignorant in innocence, or there is some kind of hardware (memory) limitation, but nobody seems to have an answer. It may be to do with *SparseMPS*, but I frankly doubt it. So I started reading and wonder whether this hypothesis has any value: this error arises for me running whisper, and I am loading the models programmatically, but when I am using the ""mps"" device it will try to load them *using the mps*, and if there is some element of quantization involved in this, that will create an error because *quantization is supposed to be done on the CPU*. That I am trying to run these models on a 16GB MacOS Ventura 13.3 makes me wonder whether there is some kind of ""*automatic quantization optimization*"" going on that tries to make the models smaller because I don't have enough RAM. I hesitated to post this because I don't know enough about quantization, or indeed anything else, but is it possible that this is the issue and that it is somehow registering as a different error couched in terms of ""aten::...."" because the code at module.py 114345 looks more like a quantization process than some sort of backprop differentiation? If this has enough legs to merit being posted as an issue, I'll happily do so, but my default assumption is that I am an idiot! Apologies if this just confirms my stupidity!

transformer,Fakify params and weights under private config,"  CC(Fakify params and weights under private config) Previously, we planned to lift the parameters and weights while exporting and implement our own transformer to ""unlift"" the lifted weights and params back to the graph as attributes. But this is bit challenging because:  We need to maintain correct ordering for weights and parameters that are passed as inputs so that we know how to map them back.   Some weights are unused in the graph, so our transformer needs to be aware of which weights and parameters are not used in the graph. And we need to distinguish which are real user input and which are parameters.   There can be more edge cases we haven't seen in other models yet.  I am aware that   and  mentioned that functionalization won't work with faketensor attributes but this is fine for the short term as we don't expect users to be modifying weights and params in inference mode. In fact, we explicitly disable attribute mutation in torchdynamo export mode right now.  Given above condition, it might be ok to just fakify params when we need. I use a flag to guard against this change.

rag,[functorch] Refactor life handle storage,"Stack from ghstack:  CC([functorch] Refactor life handle storage) A ""life handle"" is a pointertoboolean that says whether or not a TensorWrapper is alive. A TensorWrapper is alive if we are currently inside of its corresponding transform. An Interpreter is alive if we are currently inside of its corresponding transform. I.e., for vmap(f)(x), the BatchedTensor(x, level=1) is alive inside of the execution of f; and the corresponding VmapInterpreter is alive inside of f. Previously, there was a global map of level to life handle. It is possible to get into a state where we have multiple levels that refer to different Interpreters (if the implementation of an operator calls into functorch) and that messes up the global map. This PR changes it so that  every Interpreter holds a life handle that says if it is alive  to construct a TensorWrapper, one must either (a) directly pass it a life handle, or (b) one must create the TensorWrapper when the corresponding Interpreter is on the stack (and we will automatically grab the life handle by indexing into the DynamicLayerStack with the level) (a) is more robust so I changed most of our C++ callsites to do that",2022-12-06T20:34:05Z,Merged Reverted ciflow/trunk topic: not user facing,closed,0,13,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/90317,"> Should we just pass the interpreter instead? This might also make it easier to change the callsites for _make_tensor_wrapper. However, if we want to this all could also be done separately I agree that would be better. I'll file an issue for followup and merge this first to unblock the autograd.Function work. The reason why I didn't want to handle changing the callsites for `_make_tensor_wrapper` in this PR is that we would need to do some redesign of the functorch pythonside API that might rabbithole into changing the pythonside API to look like modes:  How does the developer grab the interpreter? They could grab from the top of the stack (like how pyfunctorch is doing it), or `_grad_increment_nesting` could return an interpreter instead of a level.  The ideal API for entering/exiting a level is not to use `_grad_increment_nesting/_grad_decrement_nesting`, it is to create a GradInterpreter object (mode context manager?) and then `__enter__` it. To create a GradTensorWrapper, we'd probably just call some method on the GradInterpreter (GradInterpreter.lift) instead of having a function `_wrap_for_grad(Tensor, Interpreter)`.","Sorry, I think I misunderstood your comment.

At the Python level, I was thinking that this could mean `_grad_increment_nesting ` could return an interpreter instead of an int (until we get modes).

yi,[Vulkan] Partially fix and then disable copying of vulkan quantized tensors to cpu,"Summary: Before this diff, copying of vulkan quantized tensors to cpu was broken. This was mainly caused because the shader only works properly with specific global and local work group sizes, and those specific sizes had been modified in earlier refactoring. As part of this fix, an optimized version of the shader that performs the copying was written, to take advantage of the special case when the plane size (x*y) is multiple of 4). After fixing this, and writing comprehensive tests, it was discovered that the copying still has issues on Android for specific input sizes, e.g. [1, 1, 11, 17]. These issues are currently unresolved, so, copying of quantized vulkan tensors to cpu has been disabled. What is contained in this diff?

transformer,[Feature Proposal] Extend torch hub to better support cloud serving and edge deployment," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch **TL;DR**: Extend torch hub to better support cloud serving and edge deployment by: 1. Extend the `hubconf.py` as an entrypoint for serving and deployment, like HuggingFace Inferece Handler 2. (Optional) Allow thirdparty infra providers to integrate model deployment and performance reporting to the hub website.  Background I was a PhD researcher a while ago and am now an AI practitioner in the industry. From my personal experience and observation, the pytorch hub provides incremental value to researchers, because: 1. Researchers usually rely on conferences and their own networks to find the latest models. 2. Researchers are familiar with cloning a repo, peeking into the source and doing modifications. The simple `torch.hub.load` interface is not very much helpful to them. However, industry community usually don't have the advantages mentioned above, therefore the hub can be a valuable information source to them. But when they choose a model, they not only want an interface to run some sample data, deployment easiness and model performance are also important factors to consider.  That's why huggingface transformer",2022-12-04T23:28:48Z,feature triaged module: hub,open,0,1,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/90147,"Hi , sorry for the delay in responding to you. Thanks for posting this. I'm trying to understand precisely what you're proposing, feel free to correct me if I'm making wrong assumptions.  Are you suggesting that every model registered in torch.hub should be made compliant with this structure, or would it be optional? In the former case it would be a bit difficult to bring in, as it'd require us to go to multiple contributors and ask them to change their code accordingly. I would not bet on many of them doing it. Also, we provide a hub for models provided by third parties without forcing them to give a pretrained version (although many do provide this). In this context it's not obvious what a benchmark execution would mean (since the model is not tied to a specific dataset or task). Same for `self.get_input`: what would this mean without a precise context? Let me know if I got anything wrong, I'm not sure I clearly understood the kind of changes you were suggesting."

transformer,[RFC] PyTorch Tensor Parallel(TP) User API for Distributed Training," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch  üöÄ Feature Provide a detailed API design for highlevel PyTorch Tensor Parallelism API design. This is an evolvement of PyTorch Sharding introduced in  CC([RFC] PyTorch Sharder for distributed training) and is directly built on top of DTensor proposed in  CC([RFC] PyTorch DistributedTensor). We want users to only focus on how their modules to be distributed and hide all other details. (Caveat, for now, we only support linear/transformer based models).   Motivation To scale the large model training, especially transformer based model training, multiple parallelism paradigms are proposed and considered. Among them, model parallelism like MegatronLM is getting popular together with 3D parallelism. We have already proposed a standardized sharding api in the past ( CC([RFC] PyTorch Sharder for distributed training)). Now to enable more generic data distributions more than sharding across hosts, we have proposed a new design of Distributed Tensor (DTensor) in  CC([RFC] PyTorch DistributedTensor) and we want to not only provide similar functionality of model parallelism as Megatron on top of DTensor, but also provide bet",2022-11-30T00:29:54Z,triaged module: dtensor,open,10,5,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/89884,  It seems that the output(MakeOutputReplicated) in the code is not aligned with the comment (output should be a sharded DTensor).  , Thanks! I have corrected the comment.,"1. I want to learn more about the recommended workflow for applying tensor parallelism to custom `nn.Module`s that are not covered by the highlevel API. Could you provide some examples or guidance?      For example, if the user has a custom attention module that is not equivalent to the one used in `_parallelize_multihead_attn`, then how should the user apply tensor parallelism to the custom attention module? Should the user look into any of the other lowlevel APIs beyond the ones mentioned(`_parallelize_mlp`, `_parallelize_multihead_attn`, and `_parallelize_linear`)? 2. Could you give an example of the model checkpointing workflow for a TPonly module (i.e. no FSDP)?",Has there been any development on this? ," CC([RFC] PyTorch Sharder for distributed training) talked about extending the `PlacementSpec` to accommodate for use cases where tensor need to be placed on UVM/SSD.

rag,move TypedStorage handling to assertEqual," CC(Deprecate TypedStorage, its derived classes, and all of their public methods) added a patch to `torch.testing.assert_close` to handle `torch.storage.TypedStorage`'s. This change is not reflected in the docs and is not intended for the public API. This PR removes the patch ones again and moves the behavior to `TestCase.assertEqual` instead. Meaning, `TypedStorage`'s are again not supported by the public API, but the behavior is the same for all internal use cases.

We definitely need that to be true > The problem is only occurs for the quantized dtypes. It happens, because you can't instantiate a new tensor with such a dtype directly, but our logic currently tries to. You may be able to use something like this trick to interpret the quantized type as the appropriate nonquantized type: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/7322f73c8f25caea79509805635cd05fd67dc607/torch/storage.pyL530L543","> I think we want the dtypes to match when we perform the comparisonotherwise it wouldn't be possible to ensure an exact match, right? I'm not sure why the dtypes disagree. The loaded storage's dtype at least matches the saved storage's dtype in `test/test_serialization.py` in `save_load_check`, right? We definitely need that to be true I've looked more closely into the test and as is it makes little sense. Since we operate without any data https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b0bd5c4508a8923685965614c2c74e6a8c82f7ba/test/test_serialization.pyL693 the only thing we could be checking with https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b0bd5c4508a8923685965614c2c74e6a8c82f7ba/test/test_serialization.pyL688L689 is the dtype. However, due to some quirks in `assertEqual` we aren't doing that either: for CC(use `torch.testing.assert_equal` in `TestCase.assertEqual`) we agreed offline (I'm too lazy now to find the specific commit in the PR that added this) that storages should be compared as if they were a list of Python Scalars. This is why before this PR we had them listed in `sequence_types`. Meaning, an empty tensor will be turned into an empty list and no check is happening at all:  Even if we had some data before, the check wouldn't have been doing a dtype check due to some legacy quirks in `assertEqual` https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/8b0847811501cd452b131b6153f28c254a3ee44f/torch/testing/_internal/common_utils.pyL1491L1496 In conclusion, before this PR `assertEqual` will only check the values, but never the dtypes of typed storages. Since there are no values, the test is doing nothing for typed storages.  Now for the part why this is failing after this PR. A minimal reproduction is  Is the mismatch between `s.dtype` and `t.dtype` intentional? We create `s` from `t.storage()` that has `dtype`, but we explicitly set `dtype=other_dtype`. If yes, the failing test in this PR actually is a valid failure, since `s_loaded` has `dtype` and not `other_dtype` like `s`. Interestingly, the behavior is correct when only serializing `s`, i.e. `torch.save([s], buffer)`. Plus, if we actually try to do the same with some data, i.e. `t = torch.tensor([0], dtype=dtype)`, we are not even allowed to serialize both at the same time: ","Ah sorry, I forgot about this until now. Yes the mismatch between `s.dtype` and `a.dtype` is intentional. When I wrote `test_save_different_dtype_unallocated`, I should have added a comment to explain it. Historically, it has not been possible to save/load multiple tensors/storages that point to the same location (though I think it may be fairly straightforward to add that feature now that all the storage refactoring is complete). In `torch.save` we check the `data_ptr` of each tensor and storage and throw an error if two have the same `data_ptr` but different dtypes. However, if a tensor and storage are unallocated (as in `tensor([])`), their `data_ptr`s are both 0, and the tensor and storage are not actually pointing to the same memory location, since they're not pointing at any memory location. This means that doing this  and this  produce exactly the same `a` and `s`. We do allow saving and loading unallocated tensors/storages of different dtypes. The only reason why the test for this exists is because I broke this behavior at one point and had to fix it. The history of this is here:  CC(Cannot `torch.load` tensors of different dtypes that view the same data) It probably would have been better if I had not used `a.storage()` in this test, and instead created the storage separately, so that it's clear that `a` and `s` aren't actually linked at all.",And it appears that the dtype mismatch between the saved and loaded storage is an upstream bug. If I change the test to do this:  it fails. I had assumed `assertEqual` checks the dtype. I will look into why this failure happens,> I had assumed `assertEqual` checks the dtype.

yi,Remove TORCH_API from inline at::internal::lazy_init_num_thread,"The function signature in its current state is ambiguous.  Its an inline function that is also declared to be imported from the DLL. which leaves it subject to compilers decision to choose one or the other and depending on what the compiler/linker may choose we may get one of the two behaviors for the `aten::init_num_threads` call:  1. Onceperdllinathread (if its inlined) 2. Onceperthread (if its imported) I suspect onceperdllinathread is already the case currently because it being tagged inline So removing the inline will simply make it a little more consistent and clear. The function exists to avoid repeated calls to aten::init_num_threads.  Being in an ""internal"" namespace, the function isnt expected to be called by external plugins which means that the ""onceperdllinathread"" behavior isn't that much of a problem anyway",2022-11-22T18:26:16Z,triaged open source Merged ciflow/trunk ciflow/periodic,closed,0,13,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/89511,The committers listed above are authorized under a signed CLA.:white_check_mark: login: ankurvdev / name: Ankur Verma  (a7822dbf92273716d4313c6d31ddda6f2e00dca7),  Please take a look.,Note that this VS 17.4.0 regression is being tracked as thread\_local causing fatal error LNK1161: invalid export specification on VS 2022  Visual Studio Feedback,> Note that this VS 17.4.0 regression is being tracked as thread_local causing fatal error LNK1161: invalid export specification on VS 2022  Visual Studio Feedback  Is it possible to make the change affect only that specific compiler version? Otherwise the change seems to be too broad as it will affect every compiler on every platform.,"Thanks for providing the reference to the bug.  IMO it's probably not worth wrapping this in a compiler version specific change.  If the VS team is ready to roll out a fix for this, then I'm happy to wait it out. However, that said, IMO the semantics this piece of code tries to express (inlining as well as importing) are extremely weird. And that should probably be changed regardless. The code change here would simply imply that `aten::init_num_threads` is called onceperdllinathread (that call the lazy function) as opposed to onceperthread.  Given that plugin dlls rarely call this directly .... thats probably never going to happen and even if it does, I suspect multiple calls to init_num_threads wont be a huge performance hit (why is it exported anyway?) Even so ... if there are concerns  I can move this function into a cpp file so we can reliably switch to onceperthread. The semantics in its current state make it unclear which mode we'll get 1. Onceperdllinathread 2. Onceperthread And depending on the compiler version it could be either. I suspect onceperdllinathread is already the case currently because it being tagged inline. So choosing one way or the other should be done regardless of the VS bugfix. Thoughts ?","`lazy_init_num_thread` was introduced in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/37461 for the purpose of reducing number of calls to the heavier `at::init_num_threads` function, but on the other hand, if its called repeatedly is not an end of the world and just a minor performance overhead. With that in mind, removing `TORCH_API` decorator sounds reasonable to me, but please change PR title to something like: ""Remove `TORCH_API"" from inline `at::internal::lazy_init_num_thread`"" and in PR description explain, that behavior of inline functions with external linkage is not defined across shared library boundary and very likely does not result in a singleton. Imo a better change , would be to move `thread_local bool init` to the namespace level and rename it to something like `extern TORCH_API thread_local bool _num_thread_initialized` and reference it from the inline function. This way it will have an unambiguous callonceperthread semantic across all shared libraries.","FYI  a MS C++ bug fix is underway, but it may not be included until version 17.4.4. ",Ping ...

rag,Deprecation warning in `Tensor.storage()` should suggest alternate API,"Since CC(Deprecate TypedStorage, its derived classes, and all of their public methods) deprecated `TypedStorage`, calling `Tensor.storage()` now raises a warning about the deprecation because it returns a `TypedStorage`. The warning should be updated to mention how to get an `UntypedStorage` from the tensor. At the moment, this is done with `Tensor._storage()`, but it should be renamed to `Tensor.untyped_storage()` so that it's public, and there should be documentation for it. It might be good for the warning to mention in which cases `UntypedStorage` and `TypedStorage` are not interchangeable. ~We should also have a function that takes an `UntypedStorage` and a `torch.dtype` and returns a tensor that wraps the storage.~ EDIT: `torch.tensor` does this ",2022-11-17T18:08:55Z,triaged module: deprecation module: python frontend,closed,2,2,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/89224,That sounds good. The new untyped_storage API sounds good. Not sure if we really need an API to build a Storage again? The APIs that we have today that take Storage also accept UntypedStorages right? It would be good as well to provide 11 correspondance for python storage object with c++ storage like we do for Tensor.  do you think it is worth reproducing all the complexity we have for Tensor here?, has been asking for it and I think is reasonable

transformer,[RFC] PyTorch DistributedTensor," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch  RFC: PyTorch DistributedTensor We have been developing a DistributedTensor (a.k.a DTensor) concept under the pytorch/tau repo in the past few months, and now we are moving the implementation over to pytorch with the stack https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/88180. This RFC proposes the DistributedTensor to torch.distributed. Any early feedbacks are welcomed! **Update**:  DTensor now available in PyTorch 2.0 and nightly build!

Thanks for clarifying the detailed use case! It looks like you want to use DTensor to prefetch whole layer with sharded DTensor parameters and achieve behaviors similar to FSDP. This is definitely sth DTensor want to do, and we should be able to support this with async `redistribute` ability, then pretch the sharded DTensor on a separate stream. coalescing directly with DTensor needs some careful design, but it could be achievable with sth like fully shard on dim 0 and then cat all the sharded DTensor on other dims, then async redistribute the big DTensor (some rough thoughts on it, we can discuss further about the exact API you want to see)",">  are you referring to the case when the whole layer can't feed into GPU memory and we need to do checkpoint offloading to CPU for some DTensors in the middle?

For fused layers (i.e. fused SwiGLU or even fused QKV), DTensor should be able to represent its sharding layout by implementing a more complicated sharding layout like stride aware sharding, we are currently working on this but haven't enabled it yet, planning to make this work in the upcoming weeks! > I notice that gptfast and torchtitan both avoid using fused layers because of this problem, but that comes with a performance penalty. The fused layers could be more performant, but I feel it might not give too much e2e perf gains to the Transformer model training. Horizontal fusions would give good wins when the CUDA computations are not saturated but usually the compute are saturated already for LLMs. Either way I think it's better if we could support this out of box, but this does involves some work for a more complicated layouts, so stay tuned :) ","On a transformer, with TP + Sequence Parallel (i.e. what torchtitan is doing), we should theoretically be able to hide all the TP comms inside the computation.

Is this planned for DTensor? TP is very slow without it.  TP is expected to be slower due to the oncritical path communications happened in each TransformerBlock, that's why TP always need to happen intrahost (where NVLink enable). TP's value is to enable larger model training (i.e. 70B) with hundreds to thousands of GPUs (where FSDP alone would OOM, please take a look at the tutorial we recently added). We are also working on fusing the compute and communication, but NCCL itself aren't performing well with p2p ops so we are working on some alternative solutions (i.e. we found that with NCCL fusing comm and comp is even slower than just exposing the TP comm).  is making a cuda p2p backend that would make comm/computation overlap be performant, and we expect to make no model code change performance improvement with torch.compile, and provide a simple eager API for users who don't want to enable torch.compile.  Wondering how slow you are experiencing? For performance comparison, one common thing I want to mention is that when enabling FSDP + TP and compare the perf with FSDP only, one should bump their local batch size to multiply it by the `model_parallel_degree/tp_degree` so that both setups have the same global batch size."

transformer,Return the attention weights using the Transformer Encoder class. ," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Hey, when using the Transformer Encoder class it would be nice to have  as an additional variable that can be passed down to .

It would be great if this was possible since one could very easily compute the attention rollout.

","Hi, im interested in picking up this issue for a class along with a partner. Is there anyway we can get more on information on this  ? "," This is a reasonably substantial change. I'd estimate at least a couple of weeks for back and forth? And since it's an API change there will be some level of scrutiny from the PyTorch team you'll have to wait on. If you're ok with that, then yes a PR would be nice. Relevant bit of code is here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/a6d72f44a4e8b6e9d2e878f30fd8b1d3e1197f0e/torch/nn/modules/transformer.pyL541. Rough steps: 1. Add a need_weights arg to TransformerEncoder 2. Pass it into sa_block, return your attn_weights along with regular output only if needs_weights == True. 3. Make sure to disable fast path when need_weights==True by adding a condition in why_not_sparsity_fast_path. PyTorch transformer has a fast inference path. You could actually make need_weights work for the fast path by hooking up a couple of things, but let's skip it for now. Just default to slow path when we have this arg.  4. Add a test (and probably expand existing tests) for this new arg in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/test/test_transformers.py","   On a site note: it would also be super nice, if the attention matrix could be hooked such that one also obtains the gradient of the Loss w.r.t the attentionmatrix. I guess if is set to true, one would still not be able to actually hook the gradient. I now went the long way around by creating a custom layer that inherits from  and changed . However this is not very clean ","I found that it will take the first component when calculating selfattention. Does it have any specific meaning? According to my understanding, shouldn't it be to keep all the components? In addition, assuming that this operation has practical significance, when `batch_first` is `True` and `False`, the meanings of the components obtained by `[0]` should be different (indicating `batch` and `seq` respectively), so is there any ambiguity? https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/a6d72f44a4e8b6e9d2e878f30fd8b1d3e1197f0e/torch/nn/modules/transformer.pyL544","  > 4.

transformer,Support src_mask and src_key_padding_mask for Better Transformer,"Fixes T135842750 (followup for CC(Enable `src_mask` in fast path of `TransformerEncoderLayer `))  Description At present, having both `src_key_padding_mask` and `src_mask` at the same time is not supported on the fastpath in Transformer and MultiHead Attention. This PR enables using both masks on the fastpath on CPU and GPU: if both masks are passed, we merge them into a 4D mask in Python and change mask type to 2 before passing downstream. Downstream processing in native code is not changed, as it already supports 4D mask. Indeed, it is done depending on the device:  on CUDA, by `SoftMax.cu::masked_softmax_cuda`. When mask type is 2, it calls either `dispatch_softmax_forward` > `softmax_warp_forward` or `at::softmax` (depending on the input size). In both cases 4D mask is supported.  on CPU, by `SoftMax.cpp::masked_softmax_cpp`. It calls `hosted_softmax` which supports 4D mask.  Tests  Extended `test_mask_check_fastpath` to check that fast path is indeed taken in Transformer when two masks are passed  Added `test_multihead_self_attn_two_masks_fast_path_mock` to check that fast path is taken in MHA when two masks are passed  Added `test_multihead_se",2022-11-04T12:47:27Z,Merged ciflow/trunk release notes: nn,closed,0,14,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/88488," has imported this pull request.

rag,Update functionalization metadata more eagerly. *_scatter ops should preserve input stride/storage_offset,"Two major changes in this PR: (1) outputs of `*_scatter` ops will now reflect the same storage size, stride and storage_offset of their inputs. See more details at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/87610/filesr1007264456. This fixes some silent correctness issues with functionalization advertising incorrect strides/storage_offsets on some tensors. (2) That actually isn't enough: We need to ensure that any time someone calls `.stride()` or `.storage_offset()` on a tensor, its metadata is not stale. To fix this, I updated all of the custom metadata calls on `FunctionalTensorWrapper` to perform a sync first if metadata is out of date. As a motivating example, consider this code:  Functionalization will temporarily turn this code into:  As mentioned in the above comment, this isn't 100% correct  `a_diag_updated` has different metadata than `a_diag`. If user code queries the metadata on `a_diag` at this point, we'll return incorrect metadata. The fix: By eagerly running syncing logic before any metadata on `a_diag` is accessed, we'll do the following:  This ensures that any user code that calls `a_diag.stride()` or `a_diag.storage_offset()` sees ac",2022-11-01T15:30:05Z,,closed,0,7,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/88198," This PR needs a label If your changes are user facing and intended to be a part of release notes, please use a label starting with `release notes:`.

Don't you just need to update the inplace tensor metadata; the other tensors not changing their sizes and strides is fine, because whatever they used to have, should still be valid!","Yeah, I think you're right.

yi,Some operations do not keep `channels_last` memory format which yields accuracy drop," üêõ Describe the bug I tried to switch to `torch.channels_last` in order to reduce the training time but I noticed that the new training shows quite a performance drop. While looking deeper into the cause, I noticed that there are some modules which do not keep the `torch.channels_last` memory format:  which yields  As `nn.Linear` does not keep the channels_last memory layout on the GPU, this then causes a problem, as the following modules are now in `torch.channels_last` but the input is not anymore:  which is a problem for the `Conv2d`:  So I think the `nn.Conv2d` silently assumes that the input has the correct memory layout which is not the case due to a previous module that brought it back to be contiguous.

By adding  the difference for the outputs of `Conv2d` w/ and w/o `torch.channels_last` vanishes. Probably, cuDNN is using a different algorithm for the convolution if the module is put into `channels_last` mode and can make use TF32 such that we loose precision (but the computation itself is faster). So in summary, there seems to be another problem with my training, which I need to find  for `Conv2d` everything seems fine if the input is not in `torch.channels_last`.

transformer,Enable `src_mask` in fast path of `TransformerEncoderLayer `," Issues Fixes  CC(Transformer and CPU path with `src_mask` raises error with torch 1.12)issuecomment1179435674  Description Passing a 2D attention mask `src_mask` into the fast path of `TransformerEncoderLayer` in CPU was causing an error and so was disabled in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/81277. This PR unrolls this fix, enabling `src_mask` on the fast path:  Either attention mask `src_mask` of shape `(L, L)` or padding mask `src_key_padding_mask` of shape `(B, L)` are now allowed on the CPU fast path. If softmax is applied along the last dimension (as in multihead attention), these masks are processed without expanding them to 4D. Instead, when iterating through the input, `Softmax.cpp::host_softmax` converts the index to match the mask dimensions, depending on the type.  If softmax is applied along the dimension other than the last, `Softmax.cpp::masked_softmax_cpu` expands masks to 4D, converting them to `mask_type=2`. Theoretically one could also add special optimized cases for `dim=0, 1, 2` and process them without mask expansion, but I don't know how often is that used  Tests:  `test_transformerencoderlayer_fast_path` is extended t",2022-10-20T17:39:24Z,Merged ciflow/trunk release notes: nn,closed,0,19,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/87377,"The committers listed above are authorized under a signed CLA.:white_check_mark: login: sgrigory / name: Grigory Sizov  (f897a73e3db09ed47586e32fb12ab20bd68bf0ff, a4e9b1e1a69dce87c829dc43aafdd0a3ab80df8f, 7b3e282d2e3e2304727ffab5676f3d22240b39fe)",,/easycla, rebase," has imported this pull request.

In this workflow, the user is responsible for manually specifying how to quantize everything, so the user is expected to specify how they would like to quantize each layer.  The default config to quantize embeddings is different compared to the default config to quantize conv/linear, which is why the default config is not working for you.  You can use something like this to easily do this:  We also have a graph based workflow, FX graph mode quantization.  In that workflow, we have default per layer quantization configurations.

rag,Saving and loading from physical storage," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Physical storage allows us to work with very large tensors. Ideally, saving a tensor from physical storage into a file would not create a copy of the full tensor in memory. I believe that a call to `torch.save` will already do that. However, when loading the tensor, it will be directly loaded on memory, not on physical storage. This is a problem if the tensor is too big. A nice feature would be that a tensor that was saved on physical storage would be loaded on physical storage again, without creating a full copy in memory:    Alternatives TorchSnapshot offers an alternative where we can directly save a tensor from physical to physical storage, then load a tensor in place on another one in any memory location without creating a full copy in memory (hence solving this problem). I don't think PyTorch intends to do inplace tensor loading but still, I think that keeping the memory location (as we keep the device) would be a nicetohave feature.  Additional context We have implemented in TorchRL a buffer API where big tensors that would not fit in RAM are stored on disk (say > 1Tb).

yi,Make stateless.functional_call support weight tying," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch A tied weight is a model that looks like  Currently functorch's `make_functional` supports weight tying by only returning one copy of it to the user from. In other words, if `model` is an instance of `Foo` from above and a user calls `model_fn, params = make_functional(model)`, then `params` will only have one element and any updates done to that tensor will reflect in both usages of the parameter This is not true in `stateless.functional_call`. If you pass a value for `weight`, `tied_weight` will not use that value. Similarly, you could pass a separate value for `weight` and `tied_weights`. This has caused issues for AOTAutograd) and will cause issues for functorch as we deprecate `make_functional` for rationalization Pitch is that `stateless.functional_call` should support weight tying (i.e. passing a value for `weight` and having it be used for `tied_weight`).  Alternatives We would likely need to error if this supports weight tying and a user passed a value for both `weight` and `tied_weight` (since it's ambiguous which to use).

transformer,Allow casting (instead of converting) tensors to/from channels_last to enable mixing Conv2d & Attention," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Transformers are all the rage, and those networks tend to use `BTC` tensor format: batch size, tokens, channels. Regular CNNs however use `NCHW`, and this leads to code mixing the formats looking like this (from the MixTransformer backbone of SegFormer):   i.e. lots of permute memory churn.  Pytorch has experimental support for `channels_last` for NCHW ops: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html That beta offers an API whereby you can convert a channels_first NCHW tensor to channels_last format. That's great.  However, when mixing BTC modules with NCHW modules, it would be really useful to ""castwithoutconverting"" tensors from one format to the other.  Then the attention modules could be essentially operating on `BHWC`reshapedas`BTC` tensors, while the CNN modules would operate on channels_last`NCHW` tensors (= same effective memory layout, just slightly different tensor meta info).  You'd still have to deal with the `reshape` and castto`channels_last` line noise, but at least you're not shuffling memory around.

transformer,TransformerEncoder/TransformerDecoder has same initial parameters for all layers, üêõ Describe the bug Example code (based on documentation):  Then you have:  Etc. This is because:  Where `_get_clones` uses `deepcopy`. The same problem is for `TransformerDecoder`. This is unexpected behavior to me but maybe it is expected and just not well documented? Note that `Transformer` itself does not have this problem because it calls `_reset_parameters` after all the layers are assigned.

But it could definitely be changed. Is the desire to make sure the weights are initialized differently between layers? ,"I assume that users usually do not want this. Users of `nn.Transformer` anyway would not have the problem though, and other users might already have overwritten the param init *if they know about this*.","I see. Would you be open to making a PR fixing this? We have a couple of options 1. Add a reset_parameters() function to both TransformerEncoder and TransformerDecoder but do not automatically call it. Let people call it themselves.  2. Do option 1 but also add a call to reset_parameters() in the init function. 3. No code changes and add documentation that all layers will be initialized the same.  I was thinking to just do option 1. As a user, what do you think? ","> Would you be open to making a PR fixing this? Yes, if I find the time. Not sure exactly when. > As a user, what do you think? My main issue here is about unexpected behavior  or rather, it would be nice if a normal use of those modules would yield expected behavior. The problem is introduced due to the use of `deepcopy`. So maybe it makes sense to fix the param init right after the `deepcopy`, i.e. in the `TransformerEncoder` and `TransformerDecoder`, so basically your option 2. Then the `_reset_parameters` in the `Transformer` itself might not be needed anymore? I'm not sure if people might pass `custom_encoder` or `custom_decoder` thought which depend on the `Transformer._reset_parameters` though."

llm,SVD with `full_matrices=False` slower than `full_matrices=True` & `full_matrices=False` on GPU 500x slower than CPU," üêõ Describe the bug   If you run the above test, you should see that the SVD for CUDA will be extremely slow, especially for `Nx3x2` and `Nx60x3`. Originally I was going to attach this to CC(SVD is slow on GPU vs CPU for skinny matrices), but didn't want to reopen the closed issue and suspect it may be something different since it only happens when `full_matrices=False`. I'm also not sure if setting `full_matrices=False` is expected to be slower than running with `full_matrices=True`, but it should at least be documented, since I'd expect it to have to do less work and intuitively it should be faster.

For tall and thin matrices (Nx60x3), the `gesvda` driver may give a better performance.","I'll try out the other drivers, but for my use in practice I would want to stick to stable for now, just so other features remain reliable. I imagine the gesvda driver is probably the one that would work best, as per the benchmark from a previous issue. my specific usecase is 3x3, 3x2, or 2x2 so the matrices I'd need to factor are just tiny and not tall. I haven't written an SVD algorithm (or at least can't remember doing so), but is the cost of specialcasing extremely tiny matrices worth doing? I also made this post in specific because it seems that this issue is hit only when `full_matrices=False`, but when `full_matrices=True`, the performance is fine.","Implementing a reliable, stable and fast SVD algorithm is *very* difficult. Even for small matrices (see e.g. here). I agree with  that playing around with the different algorithms that we expose through the `driver` kwarg may be what you want. Now, I modified a bit the test to compare with/without the `full_matrices` flag, and I got some very surprising resuts:  other than that, I think that the CUDA results are always comparable with those from CPU even in these notsocommon cases. Note how in the only case when CUDA was much slower than CPU, that is `shape=[1000, 60, 3]`, `gesvda` is able to run at a comparable speed. At any rate, you may want to consider benchmarking CUDA vs casting to CPU, run the op on CPU and then casting back to CUDA for your given inputs, as you may be able to squeeze some efficiency that way."," That's not a cusolver issue but likely our heuristics here https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/63d8d4f6ec5c973ad7b8669cd39ee9b550e5f55b/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/linalg/BatchLinearAlgebraLib.cppL848L853 We may need to revisit our u ,s, vt settings or cusolver calls on `full_matrices=False` here.",That is indeed annoying.

transformer,TransformerEncoder src_key_padding_mask does not work in eval()," üêõ Describe the bug Described here: https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/modelevalpredictsallthesameornearlysameoutputs/155025/12 Starting with version 1.12, TransformerEncoder uses two different code paths, which perform differently between training and evaluation mode. In training, the `why_not_sparsity_fast_path` will be set, and the sparsity fast path will not be used. During eval(), if using a `src_key_padding_mask`, output will be modified: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b04b2fa9aa52cacbdc9aaaf477d55b0af845ce81/torch/nn/modules/transformer.pyL271  The output is usually some constant value. It seems like their might be some misalignment with the expected `src_key_padding_mask` and the `logical_not()` operation. Perhaps the mask inversion should not be performed.

I tried to repro it but I dont think I reproed this issue (Probably due to I misunderstood it.) Thanks!"," Sorry it took so long, it was a bit difficult to pin down and the encoder shows the issue intermittently. The issue seems to be related to type conversion of the pad mask. If the pad mask is boolean, then there is no issue; however, when inputting the pad mask as long, the result is different between train and eval (probably due to bool conversion at the `logical_not()`). I found you can also see differences in the results in train() as well using different types. However, the differences are not apparent at most steps. Here is the output from a run I did:  Only a handful of steps in the loop will produce a difference. Most of the time, this code will print differences, but a few times I ran it, it did not."," Thank you very much, we found the reason is mainly because the old version of PyTorch does not support Long type mask.

If you runs the model in inference mode (which will lead you to BetterTransformer), or you are not using src_key_padding_mask with a nonbool dtype, you will not encounter this bug.",Hi  and  thank you for your answers!,We should allow only bool dtype of `src_key_padding_mask`
yi,Add PyInterpreterTLS,"  CC(Add PyInterpreterTLS)  CC(Add some documentation to deploy.h) This is set by torchdeploy to indicate the current Interpreter that you are interacting with.  This will allow Python op registrations to contextually select the correct interpreter to attempt to handle an operator. There is some perf concern as we have to set the TLS on every InterpreterSession entry point.  Hopefully you are not going over these in a tight loop. There is some encapsulation concern.  I sprayed this over every method in InterpreterSession, but I am not sure if this gets every possible way to end up ""in"" libtorch in a context where you could trigger an operator that was overridden by a Python interpreter, and it makes sense to ask the Python interpreter to figure it out (clearly, noninterpreter associated operations should never get the Python treatment).

Although each libpython instance ""knows"" if it has relevant state on a thread, the TLS used by each libpython instance is disjoint, so if you touch multiple Python interpreters from a single OS thread, they will all report that they have nonempty thread state, and you are in the same situation of not knowing which one to use. This strategy *does* help if a thread is never used by more than one interpreter, which would be the situation with threading module. So I could use this to solve that problem. But I wouldn't be able to get rid of the TLS on torchdeploy API entry points, as that would be needed to disambiguate if multiple interpreters were used from one thread. Maybe we should reconsider putting the TLS setter on InterpreterSession? We could just have the last session locked ""win""; you should still get a reasonable error message if it's inconsistent, and I don't have to spray the function call everywhere.

First, the easy case is when there is some Tensor argument that belongs to a Python interpreter. In that case, we just use that Python interpreter. But what if there is no argument that belongs to a Python interpreter? In this case, it doesn't matter which interpreter we choose to run the operation on: the Python operator registration is supposed to be equivalent to some C++ code, so we simply need to make sure that whatever Python objects we temporarily allocate to actually run the interpreter get disposed of when we come back. There are two cases to consider: 1. Input tensors. It is possible, if an invocation comes entirely from C++, for none of the Tensors to have PyObjects. We must create PyObjects for them, but we must also not permanently associate the PyObject with the Tensor because the caller may pass the tensor on to its own interpreter. To handle this, we simply create a PyObject that points to Tensor, *without* setting the pyobj on Tensor. In essence, this is what we used to do before we implement PyObject preservation. Furthermore, if the tensor is passed back into Python (e.g., via some inner Python to C++ call), we must reallocate a new PyObject for it in the same way (without setting pyobj). So we will set TLS which *disables PyObject preservation* to ensure that we get pristine C++ objects that can be reused by the other interpreter. 2. Output tensors. Given the TLS above, any allocated tensor will not actually have a PyObject set on them, so once again there is nothing to do.", what about the case when you have a tensor that's shared between multiple python interpreters i.e. we created a model one interpreter and then transferred that model to a different interpreter with the same underlying storage. Is the PyObject only set on the at::tensor and not the at::Storage? https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/[e5194e7ea445]/fbcode/multipy/runtime/interpreter/interpreter_impl.h?lines=2027,"According to Zach when I last asked him about this, we are supposed to be detaching all the tensors when you do this cross interpreter transfer, so this never shows up in reality.",And yes we don't do PyObject preservation on storage, new approach sounds reasonable to me There's a third case where there's two input objects on different interpreters but it seems reasonable to me to discard the PyObjects regardless, what's the performance hit do you expect of not caching PyObjects? Presumably there was one otherwise you wouldn't be caching them,"The caching actually is nothing to do with perf, and for making sure attributes stored in `__dict__` get preserved. Which there aren't any in this case."

transformer,Issue with converting Comet model to ONNX. Split-node error.,"I'm trying to convert the Comet model to ONNX. In particular I'm working with the referenceless version of the metric (""wmt21cometqemqm""). It is based on BERT and contains a regression head. The export to ONNX succeeds. And the resulting model passes the checks. However, performing inference fails with an error  Cannot split using values in 'split' attribute. Below I provide details of the error.

transformer,CyclicLR memory leak fix,"Hi, we noticed in our team that by using CyclicLR, there is a problem with memory clearance on GPU (probably it will be the case without the GPU as well, but that was our use case) After initializing CyclicLR, GPU memory is not cleared even after the model, optimizer and scheduler are out of scope (e.g. reference count is zero). This is because `__init__` method inside `CyclicLR` creates reference to its own methods and it will not get removed until `gc.collect()` is called manually. This is a problem if people want to test multiple models in one run of a script, after testing the first model, second one will fail on `CUDA out of memory error` because the first one is not cleared from the memory. I propose a simple fix by using `weakref`, similarly as in `_LRScheduler` base class, but if you have any comments I am happy to change it.

transformer,Fix thread-allocation in `_vec_log_softmax_lastdim`," Problem history There seems to always have been a bug in `_vec_log_softmax_lastdim `. In particular, there were two issues with it   Bug 1  Before AVX512 support was added, `CHUNK_SIZE` had been heuristically chosen in `_vec_log_softmax_lastdim`:  `CHUNK_SIZE = (128 / sizeof(scalar_t)) * Vec::size();` It was  `256` for float32, bfloat16, and float16. When AVX512 support was added, `CHUNK_SIZE` became `512`. The rationale behind determining `CHUNK_SIZE` has not been described, and seems flawed, since the number of OpenMP threads used currently depends upon it.  Bug 2 `grain_size` had been defined as `internal::GRAIN_SIZE / (16 * dim_size * CHUNK_SIZE)` So, `grain_size` was usually 0, as it was `8 / (dim_size)`, so, it's always replaced by `CHUNK_SIZE`, viz. 256. Since `256` was always the `grain_size` for `at::parallel_for`, few threads were used in certain cases.  Problem caused by bugs With `outer_size` of say, 700, only 3 threads would have been used with AVX2, irrespective of the value of `dim_size`! When AVX512 support was added, since `CHUNK_SIZE` became `512`, only 2 threads were used if `outer_dim` was 700.

For instance, when serializing tensors. I'm not sure what would be the best way to avoid internally generated warnings, but I thought of two options. The first one is to use the `warnings` module filter to suppress the warning at every internal call site. But I don't think that's very good, since the filter has to do a string search and it will probably affect performance significantly. The other is to add an underscored version of each function which does everything except for raising the warning. The public function would just raise the warning and then call the underscored function. We would change all the internal call sites to use the underscored version to avoid raising the warning. Something like this:  I think I like this solution, but what do you think? Is there a better way? I tried googling a common solution for this and haven't found anything yet","No warn variants sgtm, esp if you only need a few / we have a strategy for getting rid of them","Actually, I just realized that I can't do this for dunder functions.

EDIT 2: I found that if I do this, I get the errors, without having to run all of `.jenkins/pytorch/test.sh`:  And this reproduces locally, thankfully. I'm not really sure what crossref is, but I'll find out.

transformer,"[ONNX] when exporting a PyTorch model, creates an unnecessary variable that messes up inferencing."," üêõ Describe the bug I have a NLP application I've built on PyTorch w/ transformers RoBERTa.

However, if I export the said model and view it on netron, it shows 3 inputs: input_ids,attention_mask, and a onnx::Reshape_2 input that shouldn't be there.  My personal prediction is that because my forward pass is implemented as follows:  Onnx converter thinks that labels, is another input that's required for inferencing. But it's not named as ""labels"" aswell, so that is also confusing.  After renaming this onnx:Reshape_2 as ""labels"" , If, one tries to take this model, and run it with an inferencing script in another python environment, we get the following error: The script:  Error Message:  This error basicly says, that my input of 6 zeros (a dummy version of my 6 classed labels) is invalid, and needs 2 , if I substitute: labels = np.zeros(6).astype(np.float32) with labels = np.zeros((2,6)).astype(np.float32) then the error says  When I inspect the problem with netron, it shows an input right at the end of the computational graph, that seems useless as predicted to the who",2022-09-03T12:16:45Z,module: onnx triaged onnx-needs-info,closed,0,4,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/84514,Here is how I create my export aswell: ,"> Here is how I create my export aswell: >  >  Hi  , `torch.onnx.export` provides **dynamic_axes** for user to keep their calculation with dynamic shapes.

transformer,FSDP Forward order differs from that of first run," üêõ Describe the bug Hi, I am using fsdp(integrated with hf accelerate) to extend support for the transformer reinforcement learning library to multigpu. This requires me to run multiple .generate calls, forward passes, and then a backwards pass.  I am getting a warning: `UserWarning: Forward order differs from that of the first iteration on rank 0  collectives are unchecked and may give incorrect results or hang`. Some insight would be appreciated. Minimum code to reproduce:  A similar issue has already been opened on accelerate's repo with some discussion here  Versions PyTorch version: 1.12.1+cu113 Is debug build: False CUDA used to build PyTorch: 11.3 ROCM used to build PyTorch: N/A OS: Amazon Linux release 2 (Karoo) (x86_64) GCC version: (GCC) 7.3.1 20180712 (Red Hat 7.3.115) Clang version: Could not collect CMake version: version 2.8.12.2 Libc version: glibc2.26 Python version: 3.8.5 (default, Feb 18 2021, 01:24:20)  [GCC 7.3.1 20180712 (Red Hat 7.3.112)] (64bit runtime) Python platform: Linux5.10.126117.518.amzn2.x86_64x86_64withglibc2.2.5 Is CUDA available: True CUDA runtime version: Could not collect GPU models and configuration:  GPU 0: NVI",2022-08-27T23:34:52Z,oncall: distributed module: fsdp,open,0,7,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/84175,"Upon checking, the reason for this warning is when FSDP finds that not same parameter is used by using an allgather to check that all ranks are running ``forward()``. But the code looks legit to me. :  , varma ", ,"I suspect what is happening is that the dummy forward pass via `outputs = model(query_tensors)` is being considered as part of the 1st iteration. Specifically, the 1st iteration includes `outputs = model(query_tensors)`, `logits, _, v = model(input_ids)`, and `logits, _, vpred = model(input_ids)`, while the subsequent iterations only include `logits, _, v = model(input_ids)` and `logits, _, vpred = model(input_ids)`. For FSDP, the end of an iteration is determined by the end of a backward pass via `.backward()` in this case triggered by `accelerator.backward(vf_loss)`. If your model can train without hanging or erroring, then you can simply ignore the warning.","Interestingly the dummy forward pass is required as a hacky fix to another error thrown if this is not done: here.  I believe I encounter this warning even if all iterations follow the first iteration's format, but I need to verify this.",Unfortunately training does not proceed properly. :(. Reward is not increasing., Would you be able to follow up here?,>  Would you be able to follow up here? My concern is that debugging this requires peeking into the HF accelerate code and requires setting up the appropriate libraries. It is most likely not an FSDPspecific issue but rather an integration issue somewhere.

agent,Named pipe based watchdog timer,"Summary: This diff implements a named pipe based watchdog timer (`FileTimerClient` and `FileTimerServer`). This is similar to the existing `LocalTimerClient` and `LocalTimerServer` (https://fburl.com/code/j4b9pyya). The motivation is from the need of handling various timeout issues. The training process occasionally get stuck. We need a proper watchdog to monitor the liveness of the training processes. This timer allows the TorchElastic agent (as the watchdog) to monitor the progress of the training processes that it spawned. If a timeout occurred, he TorchElastic agent can take some action to kill the stuck process and creating a core dump for it. `LocalTimerClient` and `LocalTimerServer` require  a `multiprocessing.Queue()` to work. So they can only be used between `multiprocessing` parent and child processes. `FileTimerClient` and `FileTimerServer` does not have such limitation.

finetuning,Multi-Grad Hooks," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch For FSDP, one advantage of the `FlatParameter` is that registering a hook on its `AccumulateGrad` object gives us the correct time to schedule a reducescatter: The hook runs when all constituent original parameters' gradients are ready. An alternative to this paradigm is to have a ""multigrad hook"" that only runs once all passedin tensors' gradients are ready. In that case, we can explore a new design for FSDP where we are not constrained to a single (large) `flat_param.grad`. Under such a new design, the `FlatParameter` would **only be for communication** and no longer relevant for autograd. One effort this half is to provide an option to expose the original parameters in FSDP. The current approach manually sets `.data` to be views into the `FlatParameter`, and another approach is to use a tensor subclass like `IndirectParameter`. Regardless of the approach, as long as we have the `FlatParameter` interface with autograd and thus have its `.grad` attribute populated, we cannot save memory when only _some_ of the original parameters require gradients. The parts of the `.grad` corresponding to parameters that do not",2022-08-17T19:01:52Z,feature module: autograd triaged actionable,closed,0,9,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/83617,Does the following work for you?

It does the job by exposing a way to query the TLS graph task's exec_info which is a map mapping the Node to a bool indicating whether it will be executed in the current backward pass (as determined by the inputs= argument for .grad or .backward).

One improvement is that it now support multiple backwards on different threads on the same graph. One thing to note is that if an error happens during backward the state of the hook is still kept alive by the graph, so that can be problematic if someone catches the error and runs backward on the same graph. We may find a more automatic solution later, but for now to get around this one should just remove and reregister the hook to reset its state (this would reset the state for all backwards running concurrently). Let us know how it works for you!","Hi . Thanks so much for pushing this forward!

When using ddp, I have to turn on the `find_unused_parameters=True `, otherwise a error would be raised: `RuntimeError: Expected to have finished reduction in the prior iteration before starting a new one. ` Seems like if you have a model with detached params, you have to turn on this. Here comes the problem, if I keep `find_unused_parameters=True ` and enable checkpoint, an error would be raised because a variable is marked twice. I conjecture that during forward, those detached parameters are marked as ready because of  `find_unused_parameters=True `, and somehow they are marked ready again and causes this error.

rag,"Slice operation on ""ragged"" dimension in NestedTensor"," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch  Motivation In preproc we often wants to operates over variablewidth list, such as token ids in text domain, or sparse features in recommendation domain; one common operation is to slice over each list (e.g. only need first k elements). One way is to use Arrow's List type:   I was thinking nested tensor may also work well for this use case (especially when doing preproc after Tensor collate). But looks like slice is not yet supported on ragged dimension?  Wondering if there is any plan to support this? Thanks!  Alternatives _No response_  Additional context Variable width data is often modelled as the flattened value and the offset tensor. For the above (simplified 1D) case, one way is to model it as the following internal representation (which is the Arrow Layout, other layout variations exist, such as use the `lengths`):  So we kind wants to to a ""batched slice"" over `values` over the ranges `(0, 3), (4, 7), (9, 11)`. The ranges is kind of like `offsets, offsets + 3` (needs to capped by the end of each list. General nD Tensor slice support is more complicated, but the similar idea may still work?

rag,[NestedTensor]Remove tensor buffer replace with Storage type, Description In order to enable NestedTensor views NestedTensorImpl no longer stores its data in a at::Tensor buffer_ instead it conforms to the practice of most TensorImpls and uses a Storage class. This change will enable NestedTensor to use the view constructor defined on the base TensorImpl.  Issue CC(Swap Nested Tensor buffer_ with a buffer_ of type Storage.)  Testing  The existing nested_tensor tests are utilized since this is core functionality and would break these tests if not successful.  Performance One change that has potentially large performance impact is that most nested_tensor kernels call `get_buffer` to get the buffer in Tensor form and perform ops on this buffer. Previously this was free since we stored the data as a Tensor but now each kernel must construct a Tensor from the storage. The most performance critical/heavy user of nested tensors is BetterTransformer.

transformer,[Apple Silicon M1 MPS device] bad performance metrics for BERT model training," üêõ Describe the bug When using `mps` device, BERT finetuning on MRPC task leads to bad performance metrics in comparison to CPU training. Also, speedup is only ~30% when compared to CPU training.  Steps to reproduce 1. Code is given below. The is run on a Mac Pro with M1 chip having 8 CPU performance cores (+2 efficiency cores), 14 GPU cores and 16GB of unified memory.  2.

I suspect it's because of overhead of using `MPSGraph` for everything. On the Apple M1 Max, there is:  10 ¬µs overhead to create a new `MTLCommandBuffer` for each op  15 ¬µs overhead to encode the `MPSGraph` for each op, if it's already compiled into an `MPSGraphExecutable`. This doesn't change even if you put multiple ops into the `MPSGraph`; overhead just becomes (15 ¬µs) x (ops)  100 ¬µs (I need to recreate the benchmark that proved this) overhead to encode an `MPSGraph` if it isn't already compiled into an `MPSGraphExecutable` That means 25  110 ¬µs of overhead for a single operation, like the `negate` operator. Multiply that by 100s of thousands, and you get many, many milliseconds of extra execution time. This overhead can be avoided and brought down to 0.5 ¬µs (encode time) / 3.0 ¬µs (GPU sequential throughput), but you must use custom Metal shaders for trivial ops instead of a separate `MPSGraph` instance for each op. On the CPU, everything is instantaneous. Overhead of calling into something might be 25  110 _nanoseconds_, not 25  110 _microseconds_. RNNs like BERT have smaller tensors and more sequential in nature, so they often run better on CPUs  which have smaller vector width and higher clock speed. Perhaps this would not be true if a GPU had overhead of  For a longer explanation, you might be interested in this PyTorch Forums post. Since making the post, I have not only fused multiple unary operations into a single shader dispatch  I also fused binary/ternary operations and created a fullfledged JIT graph compiler. Unlike XLA, this has such low overhead that it takes *less* time to compile than to execute once. It can recompile the same set of ops countless times, much like how OoOE happens on a modern CPU. But it's limited to elementwise ops, which are the most bandwidthintensive kind of op. Matrix multiplications happen outside of the graph. TL;DR  I hypothesize that BERT could run 10100 times faster on the M1 GPU if certain optimizations are made.",Speedup is important but I am more concerned about performance metrics `accuracy` and `F1` scores. Performance drop of 17% in `Accuracy` and 9% in `F1` score compared to CPU training when there are no code changes expect for using `mps` device.,"For more context, inference of a trained/finetuned transformer model seems to give expected performance metrics. Hence, training is going haywire while using `mps` device.","Is it possible to unravel the BERT model's layers into a sequence of primitive operations? Then, perhaps I could replicate the results from scratch using the `MPSGraph` framework. I'm using an M1family Mac as well, so numerical precision should be exactly the same. I have noticed that CPU and GPU return slightly different values for activation functions. They're the same within a factor of (1 + 1e5), but that means transcendental functionals may behave differently. In the Metal Standard Library, there are often two variants of complex math functions. One is in the `fast::` namespace, and it's fast and less precise. The other is in the `precise::` namespace, and it's slower but more precise. I suspect that `MPSGraph` uses lowerprecision versions of complex math functions, which don't handle infinities and denormals.", could you please try latest pytorch nightly (such as 1.13.0.dev20220805) and let me know if you are still seeing the issue? (`pip3 install forcereinstall pre torch extraindexurl https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu` will bring the latest nightly version),"Thank you  for the detailed insights into what might be happening behind the scenes.  Thank you  for the suggestion to test out `mps` support using PyTorch nightly. Observations: 1. With PyTorch nightly, the performance is similar (same for the first 2 decimal points) (0.3% F1 drop and 0.6% Accuracy drop) as seen below.  **Therefore, model correctness/performance metrics seem to be resolved.** 2.  We can also observe **~60%** speedup compared to the ~30% speedup from the torch 1.12.0 version. However, this is nowhere near the 10X eval speedup for Bert mentioned in the blog¬†Introducing Accelerated PyTorch Training on Mac | PyTorch. To provide more context, I observed a speedup of¬†~7.5X over CPU for the task of image classification using ResNet which is in line with the blog post. **Therefore, now the pressing question is of performance/speedup for transformerbased models.** ","> **Therefore, now the pressing question is of performance/speedup for transformerbased models.** I've been waiting for this chance for a very long time. I wanted a realworld use case (specifically an RNN) to showcase measurable speedups from reducing driverside overhead. If you could humor me, I'd like to research the performance regression by benchmarking PyTorch against the rebooted S4TF. Please let me know whether you're interested in helping with this investigation.  Stage 1 My custom backend isn't yet in the state where it can test this BERT model. There's still quite a bit of work and debugging to complete. However, lowering it down to `MPSGraph` is a good start. This is something called narrowing a bug  eliding as much context as possible, to remove confounding variables and examine only the root cause. Despite creating ML frameworks, I'm not an expert at using ML frameworks. I have never used S4TF, PyTorch, or TensorFlow to train an actual model, except when running a precreated tutorial notebook on SwiftColab. I care more about making the software accessible to other people, who want to do training. So I may need help understanding or extracting the model's size parameters, sequence of raw ops, etc.   Stage 2 Investigate ways to run the model faster than one `MPSGraph` per op. Try fusing hotpaths or creating custom Metal shaders, just for demonstration. These emulate the final product of my prototype Metal backend, and may signal whether my 10100x speedup hypothesis is reasonable. Then, see whether such optimizations are possible in PyTorch. Odds are, they aren't. There's something unique about Swift, how it handles ARC and does automatic differentiation in the language compiler. There's also the high maintenance cost of my highly tuned command stream + memory management. It requires writing _lots_ of lowlevel code in a safe, productive programming language. It's counterproductive to translate it into C++, or worse, ObjectiveC (Swift's predecessor). Still, this investigation could reveal limitations of PyTorch's MPS backend, including _reproducible_ evidence of why MPS is sometimes slower than the CPU.

transformer,RFC: Add flag for RNN decomposition to all RNN modules,"**tl;dr** The basic proposal here is to add a flag to RNN (and subclasses like GRU or LSTM) where instead of running the RNN kernel, it will run the linear, dropout, etc. calls that create an equivalent decomposition. Without this, the monolithic rnn functions and buffers returned from the _cudnn_rnn function make it difficult to extend RNNs in the cases of extending RNNs, computing per sample gradients, and AOTAutograd. The proposed API adds a flag to the RNN class that determines whether or not to use the decomposed version, which will be defaulted to False in order to not incur perf penalties  Problem The basic problem with the RNN kernel in particular is that the cuda versions pass around buffers that are used during the backward computation. This is particularly problematic when someone wants to use a custom derivative for the RNN since CUDA doesn't have any stability guarantees for what is being passed back in the buffers. Therefore, a developer cannot even try to recompute the intermediate values and pass those to CUDA's RNN backwards function and hope to produce correct results.  Use Cases  RNN Experimentation For a long time (even since iss",2022-08-01T16:31:07Z,feature module: rnn triaged,open,0,4,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/82577,"> Expanded Weights and per sample gradients The problem also extends to things like functorch transforms, right? We can't write an efficient batching rule for cudnn_rnn_forward, because who knows what it is saving into the buffers it gets passed. > AOTAutograd The AOTAutograd example is interesting. There's a question of if the user should pass `use_decomposition=True` before using AOTAutograd. If we want ""dynamo on by default"", then the user shouldn't need to change their code. This means that somewhere, AOTAutograd needs to intercept cudnn_rnn_forward and decompose it and we would want to ensure that the cudnn_rnn_backward call doesn't make it to the AOTAutograd graph (because that is not something we know how to decompose).","> This means that somewhere, AOTAutograd needs to intercept cudnn_rnn_forward and decompose it and we would want to ensure that the cudnn_rnn_backward call doesn't make it to the AOTAutograd graph (because that is not something we know how to decompose).

We can't really do this with torch_dispatch mode today (because that happens after autograd), but we could do it with a torch_function mode, or figure out how to get a torch_dispatch mode to occur before autograd.",.Module side

rag,Saved tensor hooks checkpoint implementation cannot robustly clear storage," üêõ Describe the bug In the saved tensor hooks based checkpointing approach (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/386b39831745d9b87f24481b7c919816a80686cb/torch/utils/checkpoint.pyL349),  when autograd needs to unpack an activation, it potentially reruns the forward to recompute all activations, and then returns the activation for the index it is unpacking. However, we currently do a `storage.pop()` for this to ensure we don't hold references to the tensor after the backward is over. This raises the issue that if the same tensor is unpacked twice, without a pack in between, we'll run into an error. A (silly) example repro is here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/386b39831745d9b87f24481b7c919816a80686cb/test/test_autograd.pyL4598 Another concern is if a tensor is packed by autograd but never unpacked, thus leading to `storage` leaking.

To your issue  we've run with T5 and validation loops, with many T5 variations, and did not hit this issue. However, in reviewing the above it looks like your code is going through some additional HF code before actually passing the inputs to the model for validation, vs while we are using HF T5 model, but then doing everything else in pure PyTorch. To pin this down a bit more:                                                       1  Can you confirm you see this with T5 in your setup above (original text states it happens with all transformers including T5, etc), but most of the specifics seem to revolve around blenderbot.   Would be a fast test to swap in T5 and see if it shows the same just to make sure if we can reference working T5 code for this issue. 2  The issue arises immediately upon the first validation minibatch correct?  At which point you push in a dummy batch which apparently allocates some embedding related memory for the input, and then things are fine after that.  I can setup and run blenderbot directly if that would help isolate (vs t5). Another fast test of this would be to modify your code to work directly with the sharded model in the validation loop, rather than the HF generate function: ala: ~~~ with torch.no_grad():         for batch in test_loader:             for key in batch.keys():                 batch[key] = batch[key].to(local_rank)             output = model(                 input_ids=batch[""source_ids""],                 attention_mask=batch[""source_mask""],                 labels=batch[""target_ids""],             )             ddp_loss[0] += output[""loss""].item()   sum up batch loss             ddp_loss[1] += len(batch) ~~~ You can review the code for T5 here if that helps to compare: https://github.com/lessw2020/t5_11 If that works then you can work backwards to isolate the issue in the HF utility code. If it's specific to blenderbot, then please let me know and I can setup blenderbot here in place of T5.  Thanks for bringing up the issue and look forward to getting it pinned down. ",I had the same problem.,"I think this issue is because FSDP shards the model params, so after you wrap: FSDP(model) model will have sharded parameters. In the inference path, it appears that unwrapped_model.generate calls an `encoder` directly, which is not an individually wrapped unit, and we call the forward pass:   we can tell encoder is not individually wrapped in FSDP because it doesn't appear to go through FSDP codepath.  I think to help confirm this, can you confirm `model` is FSDP instance and `encoder` is not, and also print out the FSDP wrapping of model? I think the reason `model(batch)` works might be because encoder's params are bubbled up to the top, and the root unit does not reshard after forward, so this sort of works due to an implementation detail.", any update from your side?

yi,UserWarning: operator() sees varying value in profiling," üêõ Describe the bug Hello, I have a problem with the following code, causing a warning when executed with `torch.jit.script`. The code seems to work ok, I just find that the warning is a bit weird. This is a minimal example to reproduce the bug.  Spefically, I get this warning:  Some insight on the bug:  The warning appears only when using `torch.jit.script`: if I comment the line in which jit compilation is called everything works fine.  It seems to be caused by the forward method of `MyModule`, if I uncomment at least one line of the `forward` method, no warning is raised.

transformer,Issue with FSDP memory reduction scaling up GPUs," üêõ Describe the bug We are running FSDP with HuggingFace T5 3B model using the transformer wrapping policy and mixed precision (BF16) with A100 gpus. Scaling up GPUs, by extending to multi nodes (each node has 8 gpus),  we are expecting to have smaller shard on each and overall proportional memory reduction. However, we see that the reserved memory for between 14 nodes does not change very much, whereas the allocated memory reduces to almost half.  Revered memory has been captured using ""torch.cuda.memory_reserved()"" and allocated memory using ""torch.cuda.memory_allocated()"".  As shown in the table below, the reserved memory on 1 node is ~ 28Gb > 2 nodes ~ 26Gb >3 nodes ~25Gb> 4 nodes ~24Gb.   This is the same pattern for TF32 and FP32 where the memory reduction by extending nodes is even less (table below).  This results in OOM when training T5, 11B model, as the memory reduction is not happening as expected. It would be great to narrow down the root cause if this is due to the transformer wrapping policy or other design choices in FSDP.  Code to repro.  Versions PyTorch Nightlies ",2022-07-22T17:49:11Z,oncall: distributed module: fsdp,closed,1,1,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/82001,"I think active memory is the appropriate stat to track over allocated memory due to the multiple stream usage in FSDP. Nonetheless, the rate limiter should help with this issue: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/83917 I will close this for now, and we can open a new issue if there are similar issues even with the limiter enabled. The limiter targets the high active memory and high reserved memory case and can bring those values down. However, if the workload has low active memory and high reserved memory, then it suffers from fragmentation, which the rate limiter cannot help on the first order."

transformer,[ONNX] Test and address autograd.func (FusedLayerNorm) shape inference,"This PR addresses the ONNX exporter issue of wrongly inferred static shape by unreliable nodes: 1. Specifically, this unblocks the usage of apex `FusedLayerNorm` (autograd.function) in transformer. Before this PR, the downstream nodes of apex `FusedLayerNorm` are inferred with static shape even though they are unreliable (should be dynamic). 2. Add a general test case using autograd function to wrap `torch.nn.layernorm` which can repro the same issue as apex `FusedLayerNorm` did in transformersembedding layer. 3. Remove a legacy test `test_empty_like_opset7` which still uses deprecated ConstantFill op. As this node is not supported by onnx (checker) anymore, the output of its shape inference leading to unexpected outcome, and is exposed by this PR.  Please advise if there is a better place for the test case. Fixes CC([ONNX] When using Apex FusedLayerNorm, Transformers model has static shape (batch size).)

yi,optimize_for_mobile has an issue with constant operations at the end of a loop," üêõ Describe the bug I've been working on a model that I want to optimize for mobile, but when optimizing the model for mobile, I ran into an issue with an operation at the end of a loop. I'll use the code example below to show the issue:  If you run the code, you would expect the output of the torch script model to be the same as the output of the original model, but the outputs of the models are slightly off. The original traced module works perfectly fine, but the mobile script runs into an issue where the output is slightly off for all values in the output vector (excluding the first). Taking a look at the mobile torch script code, I think I see what the issue is: !image At the beginning of each loop, it applies the constant multiplication operation. The first operation is applied at _3 and _4. This operation should be applied after the loop instead of at the beginning. Another issue (which I think is the main problem) is after the multiplication operation is performed on the Y tensor (at _3 and _4), the value is never used. As seen in _5, the _1 tensor is used which is the tensor before the constant operation is applied. Instead, the forward met",2022-07-18T18:50:32Z,oncall: mobile,open,0,2,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/81651,I was able to simplify the repro a bit:   Looks like the issue is related to the INSERT_FOLD_PREPACK_OPS pass., thanks for the simplified repro.

Alternatives _No response_  Additional context My use case: I am working with graph neural networks, which involve a variable number of agents, each of which can observe a variable number of objects in the environment. if fully functional, nestedtensor would significantly simply the problem, as it would obviate the need to store and manipulate tensors of batch indices.

transformer,Transformer and CPU path with `src_mask` raises error with torch 1.12," üêõ Describe the bug The following code, which runs on torch 1.11 cpu, doesn't anymore on torch 1.12:  It raises   The `.to(torch.bool)` is only here to silence the warning: `UserWarning: Converting mask without torch.bool dtype to bool; this will negatively affect performance. Prefer to use a boolean mask directly.`, the original code on v1.11 doesn't use it. This also happens on an x86 ubuntu machine, when using cpu, but it does not happens when using CUDA. Because of this condition: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/e9b3bc2eadb8ffe10c002abcd5a34a5b7d36f390/aten/src/ATen/native/transformers/attention.cppL136L144 using `src_mask = torch.zeros(32, 10)` makes the error go away, but it must not be right because I believe the size of `src_mask` should be `(seq_len, seq_len)`.  Instead, on torch 1.11, using `(32, 10)` was raising `RuntimeError: The shape of the 2D attn_mask is torch.Size([32, 10]), but should be (10, 10).`.  Also, the comment saying CPU path doesn't support mask makes me wonder if I'm looking at the right code ü§î   Versions Collecting environment information...

Looks like cpu path assumed src_key_padding_mask with shape (batch size, seqlen) and not src_mask with shape (seqlen, seqlen)? src_mask works fine on the cuda path since _masked_softmax takes care of it.  I think the solution is to pass a flag saying whether this is a src_mask or a src_key_padding_mask and deal with the mask accordingly. There's not an easy way to tell if the given attention_mask is one or the other if the batch size and sequence length are the same.  Edit: For now solution I think is to just disable fast path if src_mask is passed in. ","IMO, best solution is probably to have parity between the CPU and CUDA paths in masked_softmax w.r.t. ""transformer mask"" support, then we don't have to continue layering more special cases onto the specialcase fix for the gap in support.","Main PR to fix is https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/81277.

What we might want to do is just make forward AD not care about storage offset being different in some cases as well, but I'm not sure about the implications of that yet. Minimal repro: ","From offline discussion with , in the case when there is no exact match in metadata, but the underlying storage representation is the same, we should update forward AD to perform a outofplace view during set_fw_grad to ensure the metadata matches exactly.",Can we instead ignore storage_offset on 0element tensors?,> Can we instead ignore storage_offset on 0element tensors?

I hope this wouldn't affect the PyTorch 1.12 release plan. I'll submit a PR to disable AVX512 dispatch for those kernels that are slower with AVX512, i.e. enable AVX512 dispatch only for those kernels that are faster with AVX512. Perhaps we can also enable/disable AVX512 dispatch according to the platform, as more recent or upcoming platforms might have better AVX512 performance. Regardless, I'll see if there's a way to boost AVX512 performance of existing ATen kernels as well. Memorybound kernels are more likely to be slower with AVX512, than with AVX2, so maybe down the line we'll see if HBM can help. Thanks!","person for the time being I plan to disable it across the board by default, because at least on any of the workflows we usually benchmarked it did not yield any gains on EC2 C5 machine.

We might need to add some more, though. Some ops work better with AVX512, but there's significant runtorun variation. I've noticed that preloading a thirdparty memory allocator (jemalloc/tcmalloc) produces more consistent results. I'll post results later. I guess we can also benchmark on AWS m6i.64xlarge AWS instance, which is Ice Lake, and has 48 KB L1D caches. Thanks!","Hi      ,  Even after we'd finish benchmarking & analyzing performance of ATen kernels (and potentially enable dispatch of some AVX512 kernels), can we still let AVX2 be the default CPU capability, so that users may use AVX512 ATen kernels by using the environment variable `ATEN_CPU_CAPABILITY=AVX512`? IMHO, there are at least 4 factors that should be considered while benchmarking & comparing AVX2 & AVX512 performance of each ATen kernel: 1. Input(s) size(s)  2. Number of threads 3. CPU platform 4. Memory allocator (AVX512 might do better with nondefault memory allocators with large pagesizes.)  For some combination of the aforementioned factors, some ATen kernels might exhibit better performance with AVX512, but worse with another combination.  However, currently, PyTorch dispatches an ATen kernel according to the highest CPU capability, so the dispatcher doesn't consider these factors. So, would it be okay to add a Python API to change `ATEN_CPU_CAPABILITY` at runtime, which would allow users to finetune performance of workloads, based on the analysis of data gleaned via prior benchmarking?

transformer,[feature request] Add support for a custom DatasetFetcher in DataLoader ," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch I'm working on a timeseries dataset, and I stumbled upon a limitation withing pytorch's DataLoader that I'd like to address here. I have a custom mapstyle dataset that implements a `__getitem__` and `__len__` methods. `__getitem__`  has a following signature and returns by default features of shape `(seq_length, n_features)` and an integer label.  Sequence length is fixed by default, but can be changed by passing a `seq_length` argument. I'm using an LSTM + Transformer model that is able to process an input of variable sequence length.\ BUT I'm not leveraging this feature of my model because pytorch's DataLoader expects all the samples returned by the dataset to be of the same shape. A traditional approach to solving this problem is **sequence padding**. This doesn't really solve the problem in my opinion (the model still gets constant sequence length as an input) and leads to a range of further questions (which values to use for padding, how to interpolate ect.). **What I would like to do instead** is to use a custom DatasetFetcher to create batches that have constant sequence length within a batch, but **varyin",2022-06-23T12:08:54Z,module: dataloader triaged enhancement module: data,open,0,1,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/80134,Have you considered passing in a custom `collate_fn` to `DataLoader` that purpose? The input to `collate_fn` is a batch; you are free to pick a sequence length and pad/trim the sequence in there as you need. You can also import and call the `torch.utils.data.default_collate` after your custom step if you'd like as well.
transformer,create input tensor on GPU device takes extremely long time when inferencing with transformer models," üêõ Describe the bug Hi Team, Good day! Problem: create input tensor on GPU device takes extremely long time when inferencing with transformer models Description:  I use below sample full code, to examine inferencing speed with BERT model, it uses bertbasemultilingualuncased from huggingface's implementation, takes random 5000 texts from SQuAD1. To speed up, the code is optimised so that it first tokenize all the 5000 texts, and sort the tokenized texts by number of tokens, and batching texts with similar length in one batch sent for inference.  Particularly, I have recorded the time used for model inferencing, below line   And the time took to put input tensor created to GPU device   Noticed, with maximum sequence length of 128, when set with a big batch size, say 512, the time used for model inference is blazingly fast, less than 0.1s for all 5000 texts, but it takes insanely long time, almost 2s in total to put input tensor to GPU for all 5000 texts.  However, with same maximum sequence length of 128, when set with a small batch size, say 16, the time used for model inference slows down to more than 2s for all 5000 texts, but it speeds up to put i",2022-06-23T09:05:17Z,module: cuda triaged,closed,0,2,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/80129,">Noticed, with maximum sequence length of 128, when set with a big batch size, say 512, the time used for model inference is blazingly fast, less than 0.1s for all 5000 texts, but it takes insanely long time, almost 2s in total to put input tensor to GPU for all 5000 texts. > However, with same maximum sequence length of 128, when set with a small batch size, say 16, the time used for model inference slows down to more than 2s for all 5000 texts, but it speeds up to put input tensor to GPU, which takes less than 0.2s for all 5000 texts. CUDA operations are executed asynchronously so you would need to synchronize the code via `torch.cuda.synchronize()` before starting and stopping the timers which is not the case in your posted code.  The very first CUDA operation will initialize the CUDA context, load the kernels etc. and is expected to be slow. Since you are not synchronizing your timers will accumulate the previous runtimes when a sync is enforced and give wrong results. ","Got it, Thank you very much! "
chat,[PyTorch][ATen][AMD] always declare ROCmBackwardPassGuard,"Summary:  Problem `ROCmBackwardPassGuard` is only defined and instantiated when `USE_ROCM` is set, which complicates our internal build system that distinguishes a CPUonly module from a GPUaware module.  Solution Despite its name, `ROCmBackwardPassGuard` does not depend on ROCm features. Regardless of its usefulness for nonROCm code, we don't need `ifdef USE_ROCM` for the declaration of `ROCmBackwardPassGuard` like other components like CUDAspecific `NoTF32Guard`. Note: this patch should not have any side effects (`ROCmBackwardPassGuard` is not instantiated when `USE_ROCM` is not set) except for additional tiny compilation time for these 10 lines.

transformer,"Add test for torchscripting nn.TransformerEncoder, including fast path","Summary: Add test just to check if TransformerEncoder will crash when enumerating over params [with_no_grad, use_torchscript, training]. Motivation for this was that TransformerEncoder fast path (so with_no_grad=True) and use_torchscript=True would crash with the issue that NestedTensor doesn't have size. This was caused because the TransformerEncoder fast path generates a NestedTensor automatically as a perf optimization and torchscript attempts to find intermediate tensor sizes while it optimizes. But NestedTensor has not implemented a size method, so things fail. This test goes together with this fix https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/79480 Test Plan:  Test runs and passes together with the changes from the PR above (I made another diff on top of this with those changes). Does not pass without the fix.

transformer,Implement NestedTensor size function," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch NestedTensor does not implement a size method. NestedTensor has been integrated into nn.Transformer, which has revealed a couple of use cases where the sizes of intermediate tensors in the model are needed. The three main cases are:  PyTorch profiler fails on nn.Transformer because it attempts to find the size of all intermediate tensors, which includes NestedTensors in the transformer.   Autograd with NestedTensor fails because it requires the size of the tensor  Torchscript with NestedTensor fails because torch.jit.script(model) attempts to find the size of intermediate tensors for performance optimizations.  Alternatives Two main ways to fix: 1. In all code that tries to find size of intermediate tensors, check for NestedTensor, and if it's a NestedTensor, do not ask for size. This seems feasible for the above use cases (profiler: has a WIP patch to check for NestedTensor, autograd: WIP in  CC(Add Autograd Support for Nested Tensor), torchscript: could probably make a torchscriptspecific patch). But I imagine that there are many such use cases and it would be hard to cover them all.   2. Implement NestedTensor",2022-06-13T23:31:58Z,module: nestedtensor,closed,3,2,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/79477,"Linking https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/79480 . Thanks for the fix! Unfortunately wasn't able to test this before the branch cut. It looks like it was failing some of the tests, so potentially needs more work. ",Note that the size of a nested tensor is a nested data structure itself. It's unlikely we would ever implement `sizes()` directly for nested tensors as its signature returns an `IntArrayRef`. I think it's better to abstract out callsitespecific querying of tensor size. A good example for autograd is providing an `is_same_size()` abstraction that can be implemented differently for nested vs. nonnested tensors (see CC(update is_same_size to work with nested tensor dispatch)).

transformer,Torchdynamo for Deepspeed and FSDP,"In AWS we are working with customers to enable gigantic transformer model training on EC2. Furthermore, we attempt to leverage compiler techniques to optimize Pytorch workloads due to its widely adoption. For example, we recently opensourced RAF, a deep learning compiler for training, that shows promising training acceleration for a set of models and verified it works with TorchDynamo. On the other hand, we do see the gap converting Pytorch programs to the IR we are using, especially when it comes to complex strategies such as distributed training. One example is Deepspeed. It implements data parallelism (ZeRO) on top of Pytorch, introducing sharding for optimizer states, gradients and parameters. (FSDP is another approach to do ZeRO). The idea itself is pretty straightforward, but when trying to convert the Deepspeed implementation to RAF via lazytensor, it doesn‚Äôt work well. For instance, the NaN check for gradients breaks the graph and result performance degradation; It doesn‚Äôt capture CUDA stream usage; etc. In my understanding, those issues could potentially be resolved via TorchÔº§ynamo as it has the capability to extract structures and call inf",2022-05-26T21:46:51Z,oncall: distributed feature low priority triaged module: fsdp oncall: pt2 module: dynamo,open,7,3,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/93756,'re looking into this and will post an update when we can.," We have support for FSDP and DDP with graph breaks currently, you may have seen these announced.

yi,Allow specifying pickle module for torch.package," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch I'm working on a service that is to receive files created with `torch.package` to instantiate `torch.nn.Module`s created by a different service. Some of the modules use, somewhere in their structure, lambda functions and other constructs that are not supported by `pickle`, but are supported by the `dill` package. Seeing as how the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions both support specifying a `pickle_module` to use, I was wondering if it was possible to support specifying it when instantiating `torch.package.PackageExporter` and `torch.package.PackageImporter`, so I could take advantage of the dependency bundling they provide?  Alternatives I can use `torch.save` and `torch.load` with `dill` as the `pickle_module`, though that in and out of itself doesn't bundle any dependencies needed to instantiate the module later on, and so I'd need both services to have the classes and methods, and updates on one side won't be reflected on the other. I could also copy the source code of `torch.package`, make the necessary adjustments to it so that it uses `dill`, and use that code instead, but I'd have to make sure it is ",2022-05-24T12:19:47Z,enhancement oncall: package/deploy imported,open,5,0,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/78172

transformer,MPS device appears much slower than CPU on M1 Mac Pro," üêõ Describe the bug Using MPS for BERT inference appears to produce about a 2x slowdown compared to the CPU. Here is code to reproduce the issue:  `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` reports `True` as expected.  I chose a batch size of 64, since that was mentioned on the blog post for the ~5x speedup in Huggingface BERT.  Running this benchmark, swapping ""mps"" and ""cpu"" for the devices, I get: CPU 18.38 s MPS 36.00 s And, for comparison, running this same snippet on an A10G using CUDA 11.6 on an AWS g5.xlarge instance (ubuntu 20.04, pytorch 1.11.0 compiled from source), I get: CUDA 0.82 s I used the `no_grad()` construction due to the comment mentioned on CC(Memory usage and epoch iteration time increases indefinitely on M1 pro MPS).  I used today's nightly build. Furthermore, I also built PyTorch from source and observed no differences on the results here. Lastly, I confirmed with Activity Monitor and `powermetrics` that the GPU is in fact being used, seeing GPU usage at 98.8%, GPU power spike to 15711 mW when running the MPS benchmark, and CPU power spiking as expected when running the CPU benchmark.  So it does seem like things are ""hooked up"" ri",2022-05-18T22:23:55Z,module: performance triaged inference mode module: mps,closed,57,82,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/77799,"I'd also add that I saw the same effects when running `timeit` with the toy examples in `docs/source/notes/mps.rst`.

",Example of the toy example run: ,observed the same behavior on M1 Max,same behavior on M1 Pro,"> but sadly I didn't observe any power consumption by the ANE module, which is too bad. The neural engine can't be used for training anyway. It only supports Float16, Int8, and UInt8, and is only accessible through CoreML and MLCompute. PyTorch uses neither of these APIs for training. Could you check in the activity monitor whether it's using multiple CPU cores? If so, it would just be utilizing the AMX to maximum capacity, reaching multiple TFLOPS of compute power on the CPU. Thus, certain models would close the gap in performance between CPU and GPU, making CPU faster.","> The neural engine can't be used for training anyway. It only supports Float16, Int8, and UInt8, and is only accessible through CoreML and MLCompute. PyTorch uses neither of these APIs for training. Very interesting, thanks for the context, I'm among many who are curious about the ANE. I wonder if it could be useful for quantized models, though I suppose this is what Core ML Tools is for. I have checked the activity monitor with the toy multiplication example above and increasing the number of steps to 1e7. I observed:  Running on the CPU device, the toy example completes in 23s, only saturating one core (CPU usage does not exceed 100)  Running on the MPS device, GPU is saturated at 100%, and CPU usage of the python process reaches 175%. Memory usage of the python process increases without end, similar to what was described in CC(Memory usage and epoch iteration time increases indefinitely on M1 pro MPS). kernel_task CPU usage around 3540%, which was not observed on the CPU device. Benchmark takes 441s. ","From  CC(Memory usage and epoch iteration time increases indefinitely on M1 pro MPS)issuecomment1132230314, the GPU may be slower because it spends more of its time writing to new memory than actually executing. Also, since it continues writing to new memory on every iteration, that might destroy cache coherence which brings down performance further. Although if each tensor is deallocated and reallocated on every loop iteration, then this bottleneck would appear regardless of whether there was a memory leak. Metal forces the memory to be overwritten with zeros when you initialize a `MTLBuffer`  something you can sometimes avoid in CUDA.",Fascinating. That hypothesis might also explain why the delta is so much worse with the toy example compared to the full size BERT. ,"I do have a workaround planned for my own framework (s4tf/s4tf) where I will bypass this restriction.

gpt,Add device_id support to FSDP,"  CC(Add device_id support to FSDP) Adds `device_id` argument to FSDP. If this is specified, and module is on CPU, we move module to this device. In addition, even if device_Id is not specified, we move module to this device to do flattening, sharding, etc but then move it back to CPU before returning to user.

transformer,nn.functional.pad accepts bool values but raises internal assert when converted to JIT," üêõ Describe the bug While working on Longformer in `transformers`, I came across this comment: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/13126issuecomment993645323. An incorrect implementation passes a bool as `value` into `nn.functional.pad`, which normally works. However, it raises an internal assert when used with `torch.jit`: Example:  `torch.jit.trace_module(MyModule(), {""forward"": torch.zeros(3, 4)})` results in  `torch.jit.script(MyModule())` results in  Is this considered a user error, or should it be addressed? Maybe we could at least improve the error message for `torch.jit.trace_module`. Best, Patrick  Versions Collecting environment information...

yi,"torch.cholesky has been deprecated in favour of torch.linalg.cholesky. However, torch.cholesky_inverse remains as is. It should also be moved to torch.linalg"," üêõ Describe the bug Not sure where this should be filed under. But I noticed that, in the most recent version of pytorch `1.11.0+cu102`, when using `torch.cholesky`, it says it's deprecated in favour of `torch.linalg.cholesky`, and will getting phased out in future versions. However, the complementary function `torch.cholesky_inverse` still runs with no deprecation warning. Indeed, there's currently no `torch.linalg.cholesky_inverse`, nor does it seem like there are any such plans. If you saw it fit to move `cholesky` to `torch.linalg`, then it seems only right that `cholesky_inverse` should join it there.  Versions Running PyTorch 1.11.0+cu102 on WSL. ",2022-05-10T14:31:13Z,triaged module: linear algebra,open,1,3,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/77166,"Note that `cholesky_solve` is simply implemented as  as such, you also have that  Given that these operations are so easy to implement, we have not prioritised moving them to linalg. In fact, as we are doing with `triangular`, we will likely just move `cholesky_solve`, and expect that the user uses the construction above if they want to materialise the inverse. This is already tracked in  CC(Move `torch.cholesky_solve` into `torch.linalg`.)"," Personally, I think it's absolutely worth keeping around `cholesky_inverse`. Just like how `torch.cat`, `torch.concat`, and `torch.stack`, `torch.hstack`, and `torch.vstack` can be used to implement each other in straightforward ways, it's still absolutely worth keeping them all around to fulfill their common usecases. Similarly, `cholesky_inverse` is such a straightforward description of a commonly desired function. Even if it's not much work to implement it in terms of `cholesky_solve` or `solve_triangular`, I still think getting rid of `cholesky_inverse` is the wrong move here. And if you're going to keep `cholesky_inverse` around, it should be moved to `torch.linalg` along with the other related functions. It's definitely not a priority, but I'd imagine it shouldn't be tremendous work to move `cholesky_inverse` wholesale into the the `torch.linalg` module....","One of the rules we follow to choose what goes in and what doesn't is whether NumPy / SciPy have these functions. In this case, they just have `cho_solve`. As such, you could consider pitching adding this function to SciPy. If they add it, we could then consider adding it."

transformer,improve index_select performance on CPU,"Stack from ghstack:  CC(improve cat performance on CPU)  CC(improve index_select performance on CPU) Improve some hotspot operators in transformer models. This PR is targeting at further improving `torch.index_select` performance on CPU. `index_select` is a critical hotspot in decoderbased Transformer variants with TopK sampling approach, also it is widely used in other scenarios like `nn.Embedding`.

yi,Support indexing of the underlying tensors for nested tensors," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Nested tensors were recently added to PyTorch core, but operator support is still fairly sparse. Notably, it's not yet possible to index the underlying tensors:  It'd be great to have simple indexing work to get the underlying tensors from a nested tensor.

"," yes, I've been benchmarking this version of ddp vs PyTorch C++ ddp, the perf gap is small and depends on the wrapping strategy. For 1GB bert model on 32 gpus with slow network connected.   1. if the bucket size is small like 25MB for PT DDP and wrapping min size is like 28MB for this version of ddp, this version of ddp has around 6% perf regression. The difference is because this version of ddp wrapping needs one more all reduce, not due to the python context switch;    2. if the bucket size is large like 40MB for PT DDP and wrapping min size is like 40MB for this version of ddp, this version of ddp has around 17% perf regression. because the last FSDP unit in this version of DDP wrapping has large delay to kick off the first all reduce; The difference is not due to the python context switch   3. if the bucket size larger than the model size, both PT DDP and this version of DDP will have single all reduce, they have the similar performance. That means python context switch is not a big concern again.   Overall, I think if the wrapping can be done well in this version of DDP and aligned with PT DDP bucketing orders, then the performance will be comparable. As you can see, we still need to improve our auto wrapping policy for both no_shard and fsdp strategy.   Once the auto wrapping issues is resolved for this API overall, it is promising to make this API back compatible with PT C++ DDP and merge them in the long run.

Since the exponent or rhs tensor has fractional values for the opinfo test the power function can and does map floats > complex  values in the analytical case. An example of nans in the function.   In order to unskip TestGradients the lhs low value can be set to 0 so that this tensor doesn't include any negative values.   Follow up work would be maybe adding documentation that includes this note. Or updating pow to promote the output tensor to complex type.   Versions Collecting environment information...

rag,Allow any operation that takes a Storage to also take a contiguous Tensor instead," üêõ Describe the bug We don't like storages, right? So we should make it possible to do stuff in Python userland without having to explicitly refer to storage. Allowing all operations on storages to instead accept contiguous tensors is a good start; e.g., `set_(..., storage_offset, size, strides)` should take a contiguous tensor. One fly in the ointment is that even if a tensor is contiguous, it could refer to the inside of a storage (nonzero storage offset).  This should probably also be disallowed when using the API in this way, or accounted for (in the case of `set_`, you can just implicitly adjust `storage_offset` and it will work out)  Versions master",2022-04-20T13:48:10Z,feature triaged module: python frontend,open,0,0,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/76106

This is the same numerically as quantized adaptive average pooling. This is not the ideal implementation, as we desire to operate on the quantized values directly. However, we are currently blocked on this as we are waiting for cudnn's 8.5.0 release, which is anticipated to support adaptive average pooling. When that support is made available, we will use it directly.

yi,Large numerical error when applying nn.Linear in RTX A6000 with cuda>=11.1," üêõ Describe the bug  Applying a simple Linear layer (Y = aX) is generating incorrect output with A6000 GPUs using cuda >=11.1  Report:  1.In the code snippet, we have a simple linear layer (without bias). First we use nn.Linear to compute Y=aX. Next we explicitly multiply the two tensors, We expect the norm of the difference to be 0 in all cases (can be confirmed by uncommenting the line setting device to ""cpu""). However a significant error is seen with A6000 GPUs using cuda >= 11.1 (Please see output table). 2. No error observed for CPU, and other GPUs at our disposal (NVIDIA RTX, TITAN X ) 3. With A6000, **no error for cuda 11.0**. 4. With A6000, **error confirmed for cuda 11.1 and  cuda 11.3**.  5. This error is deadly serious since it is an insidious corruption, without any obvious outward symptoms. In fact, if we uncomment the other line of code, it can be seen that a significant error is introduced even when multiplying with 1.

transformer,[FSDP] [Mixed Precision] using param_dtype breaks transformers ( in attention_probs matmul)," üêõ Describe the bug Using PyTorch nightly, enable mixed precision support parameters for fsdp. When running with a transformer, you will hit the following error  float expected but received half or bfloat (depending on mp config):  Note that comm mp and buffer mp all work as expected.  You can use partial mixed precision by setting the param_dtype to fp32:  The issue is specific to the attention_probs matmul:  and previous matmuls work as expected:  Enabling stack trace yields: File ""/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p38/lib/python3.8/sitepackages/transformers/models/bert/modeling_bert.py"", line 340, in forward     context_layer = torch.matmul(attention_probs, value_layer) RuntimeError: expected scalar type BFloat16 but found Float Exception raised from data_ptr at aten/src/ATen/core/TensorMethods.cpp:18 (most recent call first): frame CC(Êú™ÊâæÂà∞Áõ∏ÂÖ≥Êï∞ÊçÆ): c10::Error::Error(c10::SourceLocation, std::string) + 0x42 (0x7fa8dadacb82 in /home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p38/lib/python3.8/sitepackages/torch/lib/libc10.so) frame CC(Matrix multiplication operator): c10::detail::torchCheckFail(char const*, char const*, unsigned int, std::string const&) + 0x5b (",2022-04-12T17:58:38Z,triaged module: fsdp,closed,3,4,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/75676,"Small repo to quickly reproduce: https://github.com/lessw2020/mixprecision HF transformer dependency  you may need to **""pip install transformers""** if transformer import fails.  git clone and run ""python fsdp_mp.py"" should put you right into stack trace. adjust active policy to relevant configs to toggle between working (bfSixteen_working) and not (bfSixteen).  ","Discussed with Less offline, pasting result from discussion here:  From some debugging, the issue is in this line: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/db9f189121b6bf06f8f0825fa6e0f051c8e46b27/src/transformers/models/bert/modeling_bert.pyL985 because the `extended_attention_mask` is computed in a helper function that is unaware of FSDP / mixed precision. There is a hack we can add in the BERT code we can do which enables the model to train, but we're not sure if FSDP can have a fix for this or if we need to fix it in the BERT code somehow. Essentially we need to figure out whether FSDP can somehow inform functions that generate tensors such as these to move the input to fp16 or not. ","Hi, is there a decision made on whether this will be fixed at the FSDP layer or at the HuggingFace layer? ",It is unlikely that we will fix this in the FSDP layer. I will mark this as not planned for now.

Instead, it returned a pointer to a quantized tensor (e.g., qint*), and backend users had to call, e.g., reinterpret_cast(quantized_tensor.data_ptr()) to cast it to an int* pointer. This PR enables direct support for returning the underlying pointer without need for casting.

Also, now that THPStorage is being used underneath all storages, we're getting some failures related to the fact that THCPStorage used to do some things differently than THPStorage","I'm having some trouble with a segfault at the moment. It happens when I run `python test/test_serialization.py k serialization_map_location`, and it seems like the exact spot where it happens is inconsistent. I'll update when I know more","I found another serialization failure. The old serialization format (with `_use_new_zipfile_serialization=False`) doesn't work correctly for CUDA tensors. For instance:  click to expand   When I run this, it gives:  click to expand   Where the first two elements of the loaded tensor are always different garbage values. I don't get this problem with CPU tensors or if I'm using the new serialization format. It looks like the problem starts in the `torch.save` call. If I load the generated file using a different build of pytorch that doesn't have this PR, the loaded tensor has the same exact garbage values, and they're the same every time I load them. The garbage values change if I save again using a build with this PR. I'll figure out what's going on and fix it. The segfault mentioned in my previous comment probably doesn't have the same exact root cause, since that test is only loading an existing file, not saving one. But it is at least similar in that it's also loading a CUDA tensor with the old serialization format, so there is a chance that the failures are related somehow. To give an update about the segfault issue, I found that it's happening on a `std::vector::push_back()` call within `compute_sizes` in `torch/csrc/utils/tensor_new.cpp`. The vector needs to be resized during that call, so it tries to allocate more memory, and the malloc call segfaults for some reason. It's almost definitely not an issue with the vector itself. Something must have messed up the heap before this pointmaybe something wrote to a location it wasn't supposed to. I briefly tried to work around the vector resize by figuring out how large it needs to be and initializing it to the correct size, avoiding the `push_back` call. That prevented the segfault here, but later on after the `compute_sizes` call, something else tried allocating memory and that also caused a segfault. The `torch.save()` issue with old serialization format for CUDA tensors seems much easier to diagnose, so I'll focus on that. With some luck, once I fix out that issue, maybe the segfault issue will reveal itself to be related",I fixed the serialization issues mentioned above. Still more problems to fix though,"Hey , there are still some loose ends here, but I think it's now in a state where it would be helpful to get some feedback, when you have some time. Also, I'm thinking that it might be good to separate cleaning up the generic storage stuff in `torch/csrc/generic` to a followup PR","I've finished up all my TODOs here so far, CI is passing (the one failure is just a failed network connection), and I think all the unresolved threads above are separable.

transformer,[PT-D][Sharding] Enable ops needed in the transformer model training,"  CC([PTD][Sharding] Enable ops needed in the transformer model training) From the code base of FairSeq and MetaSeq codebase (which is essentially a transformer model), we have found that loads of ops are not supported by sharded tensor. So we now implement a simple version so that we can at least run a transformer example: Ops include: chuck, transpose, view, mask_fill, dropout, softmax and type_as. Isolate the common logic of registering simple ops into a function and for future register, we just need to implement at most three functions for a new op.

transformer,"large model, low memory: need `torch.load` that loads one submodule at a time"," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Here is a puzzle for you: Say, you have 24GB of GPU RAM and 32GB of CPU RAM and a pretrained fp32 pytorch model checkpoint that is 40GB big. Say, you want to inference or finetune in fp16 or bf16 and you have enough CPU and GPU memory to handle a 20GB model. It should be possible, but you can't load the model in half precision because `torch.load` is inflexible and requires that all 40GB be loaded first. The main issue here is that the user has enough memory to start training in halfprecision, but once they saved the checkpoint, they can't resume since they won't have enough memory to allocate the model and load the checkpoint. Are there any plans to make `torch.load` more flexible and not load the whole thing at once but do it one submodule (or even param) at a time and bonus for converting to the target `torch.dtype` on the fly. In other words the hardware requirements should be close to the final model size and not 2x or 3x. Currently it's 3x when the original is in the higher dtype. Here is the breakdown:  With flexible `torch.load`:  (for demonstration 0.01 is an example of a model with 20 equal layers) At H",2022-04-05T01:05:43Z,module: serialization triaged,open,8,4,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/75242, ,"oh, this is old  this has already been solved nicely with https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/ and it provides lots of other goodies, e.g. also allows saving/updating one weight a time. just need to integrate it into pytorch?

agent,[torch][elastic] Make final agent barrier to shutdown properly,"Summary: When workers finish their work TE agent will start `synchronize_barrier` procedure. The barrier will wait for other agents at the end of the execution. There is a race condition may happen: The barrier uses TCPStore which is located on Rank0. When Rank0 finishes the work, other ranks may still be in a process of executing `get_all` method. This means that some of them will fail because the TCPStore will be destroyed. The fix adds additional check on Rank0 process: Rank0 process now waits for all other ranks to finish before terminating the process.

finetuning,Adding novel 'AdaFamily' optimizer ," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch It could be nice to add the novel 'AdaFamily' optimizer (see [1]) to the already available optimizers under 'torch.optim'. Disclaimer: I am the author of this paper, so I might be a bit biased  :) I know the evaluation in the paper is limited, but it seems to give benefits for both normalsize models (ResNet etc.) and also for compact models (MobileNet etc.). I did also an evaluation with NLP finetuning task which is not in the paper, using the code at [2], where it brings an accuracy improvement of ~ 0.5 percent compared to using 'AdamW'. Furthermore, it is actually not a single method, but a 'family' of algorithms, parametrized by parameter 'myu'. It's implementation is quite simple (there are just a few lines of code changes compared to code for Adam/AdaBelief/AdaMomentum).  The code for 'AdaFamily' optimizer can be found at [4]  If something is unclear, just email me (email: hannes.fassold(at)joanneum.at).

Because without local sgd,  faster rcnn batch norm training can converge very well. relevant paper does not discuss local sgd with object detection model, so the limit may not be found. And on the other hand  i found  faster rcnn batch norm  with gradient accumulation >=4  will also not converge, but the normal train with gradient accumulation=1 converge  very well. So i think we may use local sgd with some specific model or there should be some regularization method to help model converge with local sgd. This can be investigated in the future.

agent,Gradient w.r.t. parameters or modules," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Often you have multiple models and multiple losses in a system. GAN for example typically has a generator and a discriminator and uses a discriminator loss and a generator loss.  In these cases, it's often the case that you want to compute gradient of a specific loss w.r.t. a specific model. Again in GAN, you want to compute discriminator loss w.r.t. the discriminator and generator loss w.r.t. the generator. Right now, this is not possible. Let's say you have generator G, discriminator D, and noise z vector z. Example from official pytorch DCGAN Tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.htmltraining  In this case you have to do a discriminator forward pass twice on the same data which is completely unnecessary. This is because there are 2 different losses targeting at 2 different modules. Tensor::backward cannot specify the modules for which gradient should be computed. If omit the `detach` and use `zero_grad` to avoid 2 passes of the discriminator, then we would compute generator grad for `discriminator_loss` for no reason. Instead, we could have the following  This is the simplest ex",2022-03-28T15:24:43Z,module: autograd triaged,closed,0,2,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/74832,"Hi, Thanks for the details.

agent,[PyTorch Distributed][improvement] User configured sigterm escalation time in Rdzv_conf,"Based off issue timeout)) I've come across, ""sigterm_timeout"" parameter has been added to LaunchConfig and propagated to start_processes() during an Elastic Launch. This allows users a customiseable grace period from when they recieve a sigterm to do any clean up in their own program. So now this can be defined with `rdzv_conf sigterm_timeout=300`. Unit testing is included to check the sigterm escalation timeout behaviour, but not the rdzv_conf propagation. For example, if my kubernetes pod is evicted through preemption or general killing, a pod first recieves a sigterm, which is later escalated to sigkill after a grace period. I can easly change this grace period in the pod to give enough time to send checkpoints to a remote machine, but now the elastic agent killing the process after recieving a sigterm is a limiting factor.",2022-03-25T04:18:32Z,oncall: distributed triaged open source cla signed Stale module: elastic oncall: r2p,closed,0,6,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/74735,"Hi !

transformer,"Training, Forward / backward pass with _different_ batch-size, no speedup observed when backward pass has smaller batch-size"," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Currently, it seems that in training the Pytorch autograd engine is 'optimized' only for the case where the forward and backward pass are done with tensors with identical batchsize (= last dimension of tensor). If the backward propagation operates on a tensor corresponding to a _smaller_ batch size (e.g. because some samples have been discarded from the batch after the forward pass according to some criterion  e.g. loss value), no speedup is observed, although it _should_ be faster theoretically (because of the smaller batchsize in the backward pass). This is also mentioned in the NVIDIA GTC 2022 talk 'Faster Neural Network Training, Algorithmically' [1], minute 20:0021:00 So, although technically it is possible to have a smaller batch size for backward step than in the forward size, currently in Pytorch unfortunately it does not bring a speedup.  It would be great if pytorch autograd engine could be extended, so that using a smaller batch size in the backward pass leads to a speedup in training. There are several curriculumlearninglike methods which could be utilized then successfully in order to speedup the tra",2022-03-23T08:36:15Z,feature module: autograd triaged,open,0,5,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/74604,I do not see apriori why wouldn't you see a speedup in this case. Can you provide a small selfcontained script that tests this?,"Apparently, it is about propagating in forward and then in backward through full batches in the computational graph even if some subsets are not used and could be pruned... I wonder if Masked Tensors could provide any benefits in such a case, CC  .",maskedtensor could indeed be used if we provide sufficient operator coverage and specialized kernels that take advantage of the absence. Thanks for pointing this out !  do you have a specific model in mind you'd want to see support for first?,"Good question :) Actually, both methods (papers [1] and [2], see my original post) are designed to be quite general, could be applied to _any_ model. So a 'general' solution would be great, but from your comments I sense that this is not doable. As mentioned in my original post, an actual _speedup_ with these methods (note the method [1] provides additionally also a better generalization capability) can be only expected  for models _without_ batchnormalization layers (see [4]) Most CNNs are using batchnormalization layers. I think these could be replaced, without too much harm, by a combination of group normalization and weight standardization, but on the other hand that makes problem when you want to use a pretrained CNN model. In contrast, transformer architectures used in NLP domain usually do not use batchnormalization, they use layer normalization instead. So I think it makes sense to go for transformer architectures instead in NLP domain. E.g the 'DistillBERT' model is widely used. For this model, I have also a selfcontained test code sample, which is not too complicated, at [6]  . So I think it could make sense to use the **DistilLBERT** model, using my code at [6]. Contact my if you need help (email: hannes.fassold(at)joanneum.at). [5] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68920059/pytorchnospeedupwhendoingbackwardpassonlyforapartofthesamplesinm  [6] https://github.com/hfassold/nlp_finetuning_adafamily","> I do not see apriori why wouldn't you see a speedup in this case. I think a simple example that shows this is:  And it is indeed expected and not something that we can easily change. The autograd works at the Tensor level (the whole Tensor) and so we won't be able to see if only a subset of it is being used. Masked Tensor does sound like the most promising approach here to be able to skip unnecessary operations. But as Christian pointed out, this will potentially require a large number if custom kernels to get to the performance that you expect."

yi,Specifying left-right-padding as tuple for asymmetric padding," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Hello,  would it be reasonable to allow padding along a single dimension to be specified as a tuple (left padding, right padding) for asymmetric padding?  It should be clear, but as an example, if I would like to pad this input sequence  like this   I would specify padding = ((2,1))  In 2D:    would result in padding = ((2,1),(1,2)).  Does it make sense, or would you recommend to go with F.pad for asymmetric padding?  Thanks!

rag,ComplexHalf Coverage Tracker," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch There have been multiple requests and issues (see  CC(ComplexHalf support)) to have better operator support for `complex32`. Currently it is almost impossible to do anything with a `Tensor` of `complex32` dtype (even printing doesn't work). All operators which support complex dtypes should ideally support `complex32`.

transformer,Tracing model parameter shapes without instantiating the model parameters," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch  Request We would like a way to get a model's parameter shapes without instantiating them. The following is an example call signature.   Motivation Hi, I'm a maintainer for the mup package. This repo allows one to implement in their models a special parametrization called maximal update parametrization, or muP, that has the special property that narrow and wide networks share the same optimal hyperparameters (like learning rate, initialization, etc). This is demonstrated below on a Transformer trained with adam, where on the left we have the pytorch default parametrization and the right we have muP. !image This property in particular can be used to tune hyperparameters for extremely large neural networks like GPT3 that is too expensive to train more than once, by just tuning a tiny version of it.  Current Implementation To implement muP in a model, we need to annotate the parameter shapes with two pieces of information. For each dimension in a shape, these are 1) is it a width dimension (which will be scaled up or down)? 2) what is the ""base value"" of this dimension?  our implementation is designed to replicate t",2022-03-13T04:49:16Z,feature module: nn triaged,open,9,12,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/74143,"Hey , meta tensors may help solve your problem. They are a special type of tensor that maintain shape information but do not allocate storage for the data. Example:  Note that all `torch.nn` modules have a `device` constructor kwarg that defines their parameters as meta tensors:  See here for more info. The obvious caveat is that any userdefined modules should also define a way to place their parameters on `device='meta'` to work like this.","Hi , we tested `device='meta'` with our package and it seems to work fine as is, which is great news. We have added a blurb in our README about this. However, looking around at some popular github repos, I'm not sure how prevalent is it for models to pass down `device` flags to its submodules. For example, just looking at Huggingface's BERT, this doesn't seem to be the case. So, before this `device` convention is universally adopted by the community, I'm still wondering whether it makes sense to have an automatic way of inferring parameter shapes without needing to change the code of a module.",?

I removed a dependency and I think it should work fine now,"  Should I be removing the generated .pyi file from git VCS?  Here is the trade off (should only impact PyTorch developers): 1. Remove the file from Git  the .pyi will need be generated by running `python setup.py develop` or similar **every time** you checkout a new branch 2. Keep the file in Git  when you go to a new branch, the Git version of the .pyi file will exist. When you run `python setup.py develop` and that will overwrite the Git version with the generated version. The Git version might be out of sync (generated version will overwrite the Git version).       We keep the file, should we add it to `.gitignore` or not?  I am currently keeping the .pyi file in Git but adding it to `.gitignore`. Maybe keeping it in Git and **not** in `.gitignore` is the best idea?","> Remove the file from Git  the .pyi will need be generated by running python setup.py develop or similar every time you checkout a new branch It's annoying because functional API is pure python rather than the binding from C++ to Python. And, that's why I prefer generating pyi file whenever `functional_datapipe` is invoked. Even new DataPipe is implemented, the pyi file should be updated at that time. Then, even though users are using `python setup.py develop`, they should be able to use these APIs. > I am currently keeping the .pyi file in Git but adding it to `.gitignore` If you want to generate pyi via CMake, this is better.","> Remove the file from Git  the .pyi will need be generated by running python setup.py develop or similar every time you checkout a new branch Not sure to follow. My understanding if the file is not in git and is in gitignore: whatever was there before you change branch will remain there. So yes, after the first clone you will have to do a compilation to get the file. And when you change branch (or modify python code locally) that pyi file might get stale until you recompile. If my understanding is correct then removing it and ignoring it sounds like the right move. Having a file here will potentially lead to conflicts. And a stale pyi is not a big issue during development.",> Sorry for coming back on the review but following the discussions here I think we want to actually remove `torch/utils/data/datapipe.pyi` from the repo.

It was later pointed out that this was equivalent to a movingaverageobserver with averaging_constant=1 which is requires less overhead and no 1 off args (memoryless) so this PR refactors the memoryless arg and uses MovingAverage observers instead, although the memoryless adjective is still used, a complete definintion was also added to clarify error messages given these changes.

We will want to benchmark this before merging it though as  mentioned that similar approach before had significant impact.  what would be a good set of benchmark to do here?,In my callgrind benchmark I see a 0.1% increase in instruction count.

Maybe Autocast didn't exist when `result_type` was implemented (didn't check that), thus the mention of type promotion doc and no mention of Autocast? If indeed this is the desired behavior, I would suggest (or even push a PR) adding a warning note in the doc highlighting the `result_type`'s result may be incorrect when running on a Autocast enabled region.","But it's not just autocastenabled region, e.g. `mm` on float16/float32 won't work, but `result_type` for float16/float32 will happily output `float32`. Regular pointwise operations (for which `result_type` generally predicts correct result type) will run the same whether in the autocastenabled region or outside of it, difference is only for ops like `mm`, and `result_type` has only tensor args, not operation arg, so it cannot predict output dtype that depends on the operation. "," yes, ops that do not accept mixed precision out of the box (most of them?) will raise an exception related to the type mismatch. But the same op wrapped by autocast would work properly. This in particular shouldn't be a problem for `result_type` On the other hand, you brough a great point! `result_type` only take tensors as input, not operator [name]. What do think think about adding a string `op_name` as optional argument, defaulting to None, in which users could leverage type inference based on operator name when autocast is enabled? My end game is having a way for users to know what is the result type of an operator execution without actually executing it. With this information, they could make informed decisions in their training script or pytorch extension (ONNX runtime). Another alternative would have a dedicated API, say `torch.autocast_result_type(opname: str, *inputs)`? What do you think?"

This was done for speed of developing the prototype. A drawback of this is that the activation observers are not present in DBR's data structures and live on the modules instead. This PR refactors DBR quant to stop using Eager mode quantization observer insertion for activations, and instead create and track the activation observers in DBR's data structures.

agent,[torchelastic] properly format (or don't log) trace info in structured error when the agent process is killed prematurely, üêõ Describe the bug When running with `torchrun` and: 1. `TORCHELASTIC_ERROR_FILE` env var is not set at the agent level 2. The agent process (process that is running `torchrun`) either raises an error or is killed prematurely due to a signal Then we end up seeing an ugly unformatted trace info (`extraInfo.py_callstack`) from the error log of the structured error of the agent process (see screenshot below) !image What should happen is that we either format the trace info in the structured error when logging or just skip the error logging and let python's error handling/console printing do the job.

transformer,LazyLinear with equal in_features and out_features," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch I find the LazyLinear module very useful in a particular case of applying an MLP after some feature extractor (e.g., Transformer of some convnet). In this case, the output dimensionality of the feature extractor depends on the choice of a backbone net, so `LazyLinear` allows one not to think about passing the dimensionality to an MLP constructor. However, it is common practice to build MLPs with multiple hidden layers of the same size: `feature_extractor (768) > Linear(768, 768) > ReLU > Linear(768, n_out)`. For instance, this is done in the RoBERTa classification head. Here I discovered that I still need to pass (and calculate) the output dimensionality of the feature extractor since I need to define the `out_features` parameter of the `LazyLinear`. I think it would be great to have a subclass of `LazyLinear` that infers the number of input features and creates a square parameter matrix.  Alternatives I think now it is possible to derive a subclass of LazyLinear and override `initialize_parameters` method.

rag,Support writing tensorboard traces to AWS S3 (and other cloud storage services) in profiler," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch I would like to write profiler logs directly to S3 so that they can be read from tensorboard remotely. Details of datasets and model runs can already be logged in a tensorboard format and saved directly to S3 with a call like  Those logs can be displayed running `tensorboard logdir=s3://bucket/prefix/`. _Profiling_ logs are handled somewhat differently, and while the pytorch profiler tb_plugin instructions show how to _read_ logs from S3 into a tensorboard instance, currently it doesn't seem possible to _write_ logs to S3 while profiling. Specifically, an example like:  does not write logs to S3 but instead tries to create a local dir of the same name and raises an error `ValueError: No logger registered for the s3 protocal prefix`. (I am unsure whether this should be filed as a bug or a feature request, but since the documentation doesn't spell out that this should be possible I'd consider it the former)  Alternatives A current workaround could be to write all tensorboard logs to a local dir, then copy to S3 with boto.

yi,Fix serialization and deepcopying for wrapper subclasses,"Stack from ghstack:  CC(Fix serialization and deepcopying for wrapper subclasses) This PR addresses broken support for serialization and deepcopy on wrapper subclasses. In particular, the old implementations of `Tensor.__reduce_ex__` and `Tensor.__deepcopy__` fail by assuming the tensor type has storage, which is not the case for wrapper subclasses. To fix this: * For serialization, `Tensor.__reduce_ex__` is expanded to return a new reconstruction function `_rebuild_wrapper_subclass` (that calls `_make_wrapper_subclass`) for cases for tensor subclasses where no storage exists. * For deepcopying, `Tensor.__deepcopy__` is expanded to call `clone()` for cases where no storage exists. The goal is to provide reasonable default implementations usable for cases where a custom tensor type uses `_make_wrapper_subclass()` and at most sets some additional copyable attributes. If anything more complex is needed, users are expected to write their own `__deepcopy__` / `__reduce_ex__` implementations for their type.

transformer,upstream `apex.normalization.FusedRMSNorm`," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch All T5 models and their derivatives (t5, mt5, t0, etc.) use `RMSNorm`, instead of `LayerNorm`. The former is a subset of the latter, it only scales and doesn't shift. The original need was a discovery that all HF Transformers t5based models were somewhat slow under mixed precision, because of ""manual"" implementation of `T5LayerNorm` where manual up/down casting was causing a significant bottleneck. While researching this I have run into other users who wanted to use a fast `RMSNorm` (but didn't save the references) NVIDIA/apex recently implemented `apex.normalization.FusedRMSNorm` but building apex is far from easy for a lay person.  I have benchmarked it in an ensemble and it gives a pretty significant gain  about 10% improvement on the full backtoback application. https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/14656  so clearly multiple times faster on just the norm part. So to ease user's path to faster t5based models if possible it'd be great to have this subset functionality of `LayerNorm` available in pytorch. It's already in the nvfused branch: https://github.com/csarofeen/pytorch/pull/1428 I will see if",2022-02-10T01:41:39Z,feature module: nn triaged module: norms and normalization,open,12,42,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/72643,"(if it's a variant of LayerNorm, should it be supported by LayerNorm natively, e.g. if weight is not None and bias is None, it should call this new fused kernel?)","From https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467 > When the mean of summed inputs is zero, RMSNorm is exactly equal to LayerNorm.  !snapshot_10 So it's the same as LayerNorm, but: 1. mean is always 0. 2. no bias  only weight  which is how it's done in T5  perhaps biasenabling should be configurable?","> if it's a variant of LayerNorm, should it be supported by LayerNorm natively, e.g. if weight is not None and bias is None, it should call this new fused kernel?  the problem is that you also want to ignore the average term (E[x]) there? So that would need to be a new boolean flag to enable that. Not sure if that is better than adding a new `RMSNorm` function.","It'd be awesome to have this available in PyTorch!! It was used again, in this big paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf","Another big model using it: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971   I can help add it if necessary, but in terms of design choices which is better:   adding boolean flag to enable them in LayerNorm?

Also I've noticed that there seems to be a test for a fused version: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blame/5dd52e250f66a5e3377eb39228cd929871f1eb5d/test/functorch/test_memory_efficient_fusion.pyL155","Hey! Sorry for the delay in answering, it is a tricky one. Given the similarity with LayerNorm I think we want to move forward as follows:  Add a `no_bias` kwarg to LayerNorm which can be used to enable this behavior.  Make sure the doc for this arg mentions RMSNorm explicitly so that it is discoverable by that name.  Using torch.compile should gives you the same performance as the fused implementation from apex. So we don't want to add the fused implementation in PyTorch.","> Using torch.compile should gives you the same performance as the fused implementation from apex. So we don't want to add the fused implementation in PyTorch. `torch.compile` is very very very very far from being ready for general use. Most of my attempts at using it failed. You can see multiple bug reports I have filed about it. It only works in very specific situations. But if this request is put on hold for another year it might come through. Which is fine too, since we do have `apex`. It's just a big pain to install.","`torch.compile` along with `JIT` before it has historically not worked well for NLP models which tend to be more dynamic. It'd be nice to prioritize some core development until compilers like that are stabilized.  tbh, if I could just use `torch.compile` for oneoff modules, that'd be sick. It feels like overkill to try to compile an entire model. ","Just fyi, RMSNorm isn't just LayerNorm without bias (otherwise we could have use the functional method that allows to not pass bias). You need also to remove mean estimation. Totally fine with the plan to use `torch.compile` as the main way forward. I'll just use `apex` version for now.", (also `bias=False` naming is probably better (to match nn.Linear's arguments' naming),"yes `bias` is not great as it is usually just the bias weight but here it also means the centering is also removed (you don't remove the average bias). Do you think `rms_only=True` would be a better name? > tbh, if I could just use torch.compile for oneoff modules, that'd be sick. It feels like overkill to try to compile an entire model.  this is the whole point of torch.compile (and the big difference with existing jit in ML frameworks) it is designed to work with partial graphs and small pieces! What I heard from  is that in the case of RMSNorm, torch.compile is able to generate a good compiled version. So wrapping just that one layer implementing it will give you a fused version.","Thank you for clarifying that one doesn't have to compile the whole model to fuse just one component, albanD. That's great! I disagree that this should be left to users. You want pytorch to be the winning framework, correct? Make it great out of the box. Expecting users to figure out that they need to `compile` `RMSNorm` to make it faster is not a great strategy, IMHO. If it works why not `compile` it by default then and give an option to opt out?","I tend to agree with  as pytorch core/domain libraries is an important source of idioms that are adopted by the community. So if RmsNorm module can be implemented trivially in core by torch.compiling around simple impl, it's great to have it in core + tests + perf tests. Then this could also be a showcase/doc reference of usecase where torch.compile works great (kind of dogfooding).","Yeah, if compiling works, why not offer outofthebox PyTorch modules that have been compiled together? Especially, modules that are used in stateoftheart models.  Most stateoftheart models cannot be built in PyTorch because they require many layers that are not readily available and are hard to implement. The community is needing to use libraries like `apex` which are hard to use. "," the problem is that we need to do a zerotoone of having torch.compile inside regular torch library code. This is a reasonable thing to want to do, but there hasn't really been any emphasis on it (since most of the effort has been on torch.compile with full libraries). Because there is no emphasis on this style of use case, there are big perf gaps (e.g., guard evaluation overhead matters a lot more in this regime). So to make your suggestion into reality, we need to also spend some time making this work well. Or we just enlist the OSS community's help in just adding the FusedRMSNorm into the framework directly and kick the can a few more months.","> I disagree that this should be left to users. You want pytorch to be the winning framework, correct? Make it great out of the box. This is definitely the long term vision where compile will be always there, optimizing what it can and leaving the rest as python code. In that world, users won't have to figure out they need compile. They just always use it and will get the perf out of the box. Right now we're in a weird transition period though as, as you said, this is not stable enough to be in this alwayson state. And so the question is still open on how to best spend our ressources: add more fused oneoff kernels that will be obsolete when compile is the default or work on making compile the default. I think our current stance is to still add these fused kernels for things that are critical right now or that compile will not handle well any time soon (SDPA, adamw for example) and focus the rest of our efforts to making compile the default. To come back to this particular issue, adding the new flag to be able to do RMSNorm is a definite ""yes we want it"" but adding the fused implementation is more ""we would accept a simple PR but no one on the core team is working on it"".","I think, having certain things in core that are torch.compile'd demonstrates to the users maturity of the technology, so it's a good goal to have by itself. Plus, in core you could have automated perf tests comparing it against legacy apex fused kernels. If wanted, this stuff could go into some separate experimental pytorch package (from where kernels can graduate into core). As long as it's built/released/tested along with the rest of pytorch, it's already strictly better than apex. Once pytorch core has torch.compile'd kernels, it will show true commitment to the technology","If things are unstable, yet, it'd be wasteful to allocate resources to do such porting because an automatic solution is ""imminent"", then I think it's perfectly fine to close this feature request and tell the user to use `apex` if they want speed  a user who can figure out how to compile `RMSNorm` will surely be able to build `apex`, so I don't really see any advantage here if it's not something available out of the box.","We **unify** the `LayerNorm` and `RMSNorm` in PreNormalization Transformers in our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14858. The arithmetic equivalence allows us to convert PreLayerNorm Transformers into PreRMSNorm models without impact on the model functionality. Considering that RMSNorm offers superior efficiency compared to LayerNorm in theory, we believe that providing an official RMSNorm API would greatly benefit the community, allowing them to harness this improvement in both training and inference effectively. We also release our implementation https://github.com/ZixuanJiang/prermsnormtransformer for reference. Thanks for your consideration.","Following up on the discussion here, from further discussion, it seems like `LayerNorm` is given by  $y = \\frac{x  \\mathrm{E}[x]}{ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[x] + \\epsilon}} * \\gamma + \\beta$ where the $\\epsilon$ is added for numerical stability and `RMSNorm` is given by  $y = \\frac{x}{ RMS(x)} * \\gamma$ (with maybe an optional $+  \\beta$ per this commentissuecomment1035594258))  Where  $Var(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}  (x_i  E[x])^2$ and  $RMS(x) =  \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}   (x_i)^2}$ ($\\epsilon$ could also be used for numerical stability in this calculation) so `RMSNorm` defers from `LayerNorm` on 3 counts  1) don't subtract `E[x]` from the numerator 2) use `RMS(x)` rather than $\\sqrt{Var(x) + \\epsilon}$ in the denominator 3) (perhaps) don't learn an elementwise affine bias  If my understanding here is correct, we would accept the addition of `RMSNorm` as a new `torch.nn.Module` that is separate from `LayerNorm`",It also seems that there's a RMSNorm impl in flashattention (fused with dropout): https://github.com/DaoAILab/flashattention/blob/4f285b354796fb17df8636485b9a04df3ebbb7dc/flash_attn/ops/rms_norm.pyL11,"Am I also understanding correctly that semantically `RMSNorm(x) := F.normalize(x, dim = dim, p = 2, eps = eps) * sqrt(D) * gamma`? modulo different treatment of eps (F.normalize clamps the denom by eps from below, and rmsnorm adds eps to the underthesqrt expression)",There is also an impl of RMSNorm in Triton at https://github.com/kakaobrain/trident/blob/main/trident/kernel/rms_norm.py  maybe can be incorporated into core?,+1,Any progress on this issue ? cc:  ,as a matter of fact the rmsnorm from FasterTransformer is much faster than Apex' https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer/blob/main/src/fastertransformer/kernels/layernorm_kernels.cu,"Could you please share some factual information to support this claim, ?", I can try to make a unitary snippet but can tell you in this PR https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMTpy/pull/2539/files it had a huge impact on inference tok/sec for a Mistral7B LM for instance.

Also, the test case for JIT serialization of the `nn.Linear` module was failing because the JIT code that it compiles into has changed slightly since 1.10, a change unrelated to `TypedStorage`. I decided to just use `nn.Conv` instead. I ran the script using the `save` option in pytorch 1.10, then ran it with the `load` option in pytorch 1.10, the current master branch, and the branch for this PR to check that saving from pytorch 1.10 is compatible with all three of these different versions of python. These all passed. I also saved from the master branch and this PR's branch, and those were also fully compatible.

One of my operation is to compute the inverse of the covariance matrix in a batched manner. I found an implementation using the cholesky, which makes me excited. But later I found it only supports 2d input, so I would like to ask a new feature to make it support batched input [..., 2d].  Thanks a lot in advance. Best, Ge Li  Alternatives _No response_  Additional context _No response_ ",2022-02-04T14:39:04Z,module: docs triaged enhancement module: linear algebra,closed,0,5,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/72334,"Even though we should mentoin this somewhere, you can imitate cholesky inv and cholesky solve via  `linalg.solve_triangular`. ~~This is because `LL^TX = B` can be solved via two `solve_triangular`s, one with `L` and the other one with `L^T`. Set `B=Id` and you have the inverse.~~ Even better, you can do `X = L^{1} = solve_triangular(L, Id)` and then your inverse is given by `X^T`. As always, I'd very much recommend you not to use the inverse and then multiply, but doing solves agianst hte matrix that you want to multiply to later on. ",Both `torch.cholesky_inverse` and `torch.cholesky_solve` support batched inputs and they use the same backend function so their performance should roughly be the same. It's an oversight in the documentation that it specifies only 2D inputs. ,"Hi, thanks a lot for your answer and support.  I did not know these cholesky's functions by heart before.  Maybe one other question: Do the cholesky_inverse and cholesky_solve functions offer same numerical stabilities?  We know that normally doing the solve() instead of inverse() can offer better numerical stabilities. ","As Lezcano mentioned above if the intention is to multiply the inverse by some other matrix, often it should be more efficient to use the solve function to do that. Internally, `torch.cholesky_inverse(L)` computes the result by calling `torch.cholesky_solve(eye(L.shape[0]), L)`. Leaving performance aside, I don't know whether the accuracy would differ much. This answer on Math.StackExchange suggests that the forward error of using the inverse explicitly or solving the linear system is about the same.","Thanks again for your answer, I have no more doubt. Please feel free to close this issue, or maybe after the documentation has been updated.  :+1:  Best, Ge Li"
transformer,Transformer Initialization,"While you took care of this in the tutorial on Transformers and `nn.Transformer`. I just used `nn.TransformerEncoder` and realized that this won't initialize parameters in a sensible way on its own. One would create an encoder like this:  This will yield a Transformer that has the same initialization in all layers, which I think rarely is what you want in neural networks, so it is unexpected. You always need to initialize from the outside again. This is not the usual case in PyTorch and not documented, see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.TransformerEncoder.htmltorch.nn.TransformerEncoder I am not sure which way to better resolve this, through a changed `nn.TransformerEncoder` API, just documentation or whether you are working on a rewrite anyways already. Thus, I raised this as an issue first.  Versions This is a problem in the current version (1.10). This bug does not need to be reproduced, but can be seen relatively easy from the source code of `nn.TransformerEncoder`.

I suspect that making it conform to the initialization requirements of the rest of the library is what makes the most sense.,"This occurs because `TransformerEncoder` / `TransformerDecoder` have the unfortunate distinction of being the only modules that accept a sublayer and **clone** it N times. In contrast, the RNN modules create the N layers internally and initialize their weights from the same distribution, but not with the exact same values. It would be BCbreaking to change this behavior, and there is a longerterm redesign in progress already. For now, we'd accept a PR adding a warning to the docs indicating that explicit manual initialization is recommended.",Was digging through an opensource VALLE implementation and found this exact bug had gone unnoticed.

transformer,Regression in multi-node training speed with Transformers + PyTorch," üêõ Describe the bug We have seen a regression in multinode training speed with the Huggingface Transformers CLM test case happening at PyTorch commit 38ac9e6 which reverts commit 3957ed4 ""[DDP] Disable reducer hooks from running outside of DDP backwards"". Between those two commits I get around 28 `train_samples_per_second` (as reported by the CLM test) using two nodes with 4xNVIDIA A100 GPUs each. Afterwards speed drops to around 10 `train_samples_per_second`. This can be reliably reproduced every time. My testing script can be found here, although it's a bit difficult to reproduce at it requires building the singularity containers and a cluster with at least two nodes: https://github.com/mvsjober/pytorchclmtestcase/blob/main/pytorch_clm_test.sh The PyTorch container has been created with this build recipe.

rag,[acc_tracer] Add test coverage for retracing,"Summary: Added coverage for reshape specifically which required a fix. The problem for `acc_ops.reshape` as best as I understand:  `torch.reshape` requires the `shape` arg to be a `tuple` of `ints`  If `torch.reshape` is passed a `tuple` where the first element is not an `int`, it throws a TypeError e.g. `TypeError: reshape(): argument 'shape' (position 2) must be tuple of ints, not tuple`   If the `shape` we're reshaping to is an FX Proxy then this type error will be thrown. This happens when the first element of the `shape` tuple is a Proxy because it's inputdependent.  As a workaround we use `tensor.reshape` instead of `torch.reshape`, which doesn't do equivalent type checking for a `tuple` of `ints`.

We do the bookkeeping at our side to create the tensors in the device and run ops with the strided tensor semantics. However, since this is a lazy tensor, there is no storage attached so we would not be able to expose a storage for them and use has_same_storage functionality. This is why we wanted to create it as a virtual so that we can refer to our bookkeeping and return true/false based on whether they are strided or not. Is there anything wrong to keep the strided tensor bookkeeping inside the backend bridge for a lazy tensor? It feels a bit restrictive, as we do create lazy tensors with strided/view semantics, but we can't have an API like is_alias_of that can be overridden and hence we are blocked on DDP usage. > Hey! >  > From more internal discussion on this, I think the main point are: >  > * We should rename is_alias_of to has_same_storage.

They also need advanced viewing/striding functions etc. So you do need to provide the full ""strided Tensor API"" to be able to use that feature. The fact that there is a storage, size, stride, etc are just pieces of that API. If you do have all of these, I don't see why you cannot have a Storage object here since you do have one. Note that when I talk about Storage object here, I mean the ""Storage"" objects stored by your TensorImpl. This doesn't have to be the PyTorch vanilla Storage though. Advanced features like Functionalization have a special Storage class that they set on their custom TensorImpl. In your case, you can have a LazyStorage object that will allow you to use all the Tensor methods asis without issues."," I want to connect you with  from our side working on DDP design for lazy tensor core.  It's still in early stages, but we'll want to solve the same things so let's work together on a solution.",">  Thanks for the suggestions  . Currently we have the lazy tensor as storageless (similar to torch/XLA), so the TensorImpl doesn't use a storage object and has_storage()/storage() will return false/raise error.

rag,is_alias_of support for storageless tensors," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch Motivation:  Torch DDP code uses is_alias_of() for two tensors to check if they share the same storage. The current is_alias_of() API on the tensor checks if the underlying Storage class for both the tensors has a common storage_impl_. This is also not a virtual method, so not an overridable API for the tensor currently. For backends like HPU, that use lazy storageless tensors and uses DDP for distributed training, the is_alias_of() API doesn't work.  Pitch:  The is_alias_of() API by default should check if the tensor has storage, before comparing the storage_impl_. This should ensure for storageless tensors, the default API doesn't fail with no storage error. Also, the is_alias_of() API needs to be virtual, so that a backend can override it and provide its own implementation for  is_alias_of(). The backend can provide a result by using its own mechanism to detect alias tensors that are storageless. For HPU lazy storageless tensors, the backend would determine if they tensors are sharing storage internally on the device and return a result accordingly.

rag,[RFC] Hierarchical Model Averaging (Hierarchical SGD)," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch  Infeasibility of Frequent Global Synchronization Nowadays powerful industry users (not necessarily in FAANG) like Cruise, Microsoft, and Tesla are moving towards scaling largescale training to 100+ or even 1K+ GPUs. DDP, as the most welladopted data parallelism implementation in PyTorch, fully synchronizes the gradients of all the processes at each iteration by default, which may lead to a low scaling efficiency in this case (let's assume that it may not be feasible to afford highbandwidth network environment like InfiniBand/EFA or highend GPUs for many companies). The key is that, the global synchronization at each iteration can become infeasible at a very large scale, at least for some industry users. Therefore, we may need to consider replacing the default SyncSGD with a combination of frequent partial synchronization and infrequent global synchronization. One solution I contributed to PyTorch is postlocalSGD), based on model averaging paradigm, as implemented in this module. Now it seems that the ownership is transferred to varma.

It's an interesting read. I think this paper focuses more on a faulttolerant allreduce implementation over extremely heterogeneous and extremely unreliable (potentially **preemptible**) devices. In the authors' words, the feasible environment is **spot instances or volunteer PCs**. Specifically, the heterogeneous experimental setups in the paper are: 1) 81 heterogeneous GPUs across 64 servers and **across 2 data centers**, and **additional latency is injected**.  2) 66 **preemptible** heterogeneous GPUs, and 34 of them are various devices rented on a public marketplace, spread **across 3 continents**. Honestly, I don't think the above extreme heterogeneity and unreliability would be practical for almost all the decent industry users. Except for the extreme setup in the paper, I really doubt Moshpit SGD that requires tworound allreduce involving all the nodes could still outperform more commonly used model averaging approaches or Gossip SGD, and I will be also very surprised if Yandex will have a feasible production environment to adopt Moshpit SGD. Note that if the paper targets a federated learning setup, I don't think PyTorch DDP is a fair comparison, since it's hard to imagine that allreduce will be used for federated learning. By contrast, this RFC targets a much more common scenario in industry  a large number of homogeneous GPUs: each machine usually has multiple GPUs (so the  of machines are much smaller than the  of GPUs), and these machines are usually in the same cluster.","Yeah, I mostly referred to its separation of nodes into groups and aggregation happening within those groups, so maybe that aspect is related to the proposed hierarchical grouping / aggregation.","Thanks for the proposal Yi!

rag,[RFC] Cross-Process Performance Analysis: Straggler Detection," üöÄ The feature, motivation and pitch  Motivation: Limitation of Existing Profiling Approach To conduct PyTorch distributed training performance analysis, currently a recommended way is profiling by using PyTorch profiler or Nsight. As a result, every profiled process can output a trace file, and users usually only need to take one or two representative files to analyze (mostly for the case of data parallelism). However, one limitation of such approach is no easy support for crossprocess performance analysis. A prominent example is **straggler detection**, because it's hard to identify straggling by only looking into a small number of individual trace files, and if the training runs at a relatively large scale, it's also impractical for users to eyeball a large number of trace files.  Impact Note that as we scale out trainings to more and more machines nowadays, straggler issues can become increasingly common, especially given that the most welladopted PyTorch distributed training implementation, DDP is highly sensitive to stragglers  the allreducebased gradient synchronization has to wait for the slowest process at every iteration.

I know you mentioned ease of use, will the use case not be satisfied by using DDP APIs such as `get_logging_data` or enabling this detection with TORCH_DISTRIBUTED_DEBUG?  Longer term, ideally outputs from something like `_get_ddp_logging_data` should be visible in Tensorboard for OSS users.

I am not sure if we want to view straggler as a **bug** here. This may cause some user confusion. > Longer term, ideally outputs from something like _get_ddp_logging_data should be visible in Tensorboard for OSS users. This can be a good idea.

Currently my end will only need to target DDP scope. > If you would like to cover all collectivebased features (DDP/ZeRO/FSDP), having a context manager might be more generic. Personally I probably will prefer an alternate approach, which can be a separate module to run some offline analysis over traces collected by torch profiler. A few reasons: 1. In practice, users may want to run profiling first instead of directly running straggler detection, so it would be nice if we can incorporate such a new context manager into profiler context manager. We still have the advantage of not being restricted to any specific collective communication. 2. Microsoft folks working on profiler told me that they plan to upstream a module PT1.11, which can provide an API to conveniently export perf stats from trace files. This makes such route more viable in the future. 3. This approach can not only support straggler detection, but also other tracebased analysis as well. On the other hand, I think a debug DDP comm hook (or some analysis based on DDP logging data) for straggler detection can still make sense. 1. It's more lightweight than enabling profiling, which is often more than adding a context manager for multinode training in practice. Profiling often requires other setup like uploading trace files to a cloud storage w/o exceeding the rate limit. 2. It's much easier for industrial users to deploy a DDP comm hook (or enable DDP logging) than to add a context manager out of training loop fleet wide, because setting up a DDP comm hook or (DDP logging) can be totally decoupled from the training loop, which means such setup could be done in one place. In contrast, for industrial users every use case usually has a different training loop in different files, and hence the workload will be much larger, unless a higherlevel API (probably based on Lightning or Ignite) has unified these loops in one place.",Adding hipri as straggler detection has come up quite a bit both internally and for use cases in OSS,Did some other PR meet this need? Trying to track down some stragglers but it seems discussion of them in general is rare across the PyTorch ecosystem.,The way we do this internally is we have a high performance structured logging system (Scuba) and we send data from all ranks there and then can look for patterns across multiple ranks. Not sure what the best OSS equivalents here are though.,

As a side note, I reckon you've already tried this, but does the training succeed when you do not register the parametrisations?",Thanks Lezcano  for your reply. I cannot share the model but I can reproduce the issue consistently with different models. Here is how I use the parametrization.  Overall the training works WITHOUT the parametrization (standard Conv2D instead of SWSConv2d) but an ideal scenario because the SWS helps the convergence. I have in my models a siamese network for feature extraction which reuses the same weights 2 times. The training also works WITH the parametrization SWSConv2d and with torch.nn.utils.parametrize.cached(): commented. It only failed with the cache enabled randomly during training. I suspect the backward pass try to recompute gradients on SWSConv2d already computed in the past. I do not know if we can force to keep the gradients in a cached parametrization?,"What seems odd to me from thatis the line `self.weight.to(input.device, copy=True)`. Why do you move it to a different device, rather than creating `nn.Sequential` in the correct device or moving the whole model to the correct device via `to(device)`?","That's a good point.

Not sure how the weights should be cached?, + caches + multi GPU setups. I'm not sure of what's the behaviour of `parametrization`s together with DDP.,The issue is easier to reproduce with DP and autograddetectanomaly. I am wondering if the problem is simply the cache is global and not thread safe?,"Can you share what your training loop looks like as well please? Or even better a full example we can run to reproduce this? Note that the cached result is computed in a differentiable way. So if you do multiple backwards within the cached context, you are trying to backward multiple times indeed so I would expect this error.","Unfortunately this is a lot of code I cannot share but I will try to create a minimal example to reproduce the issue. I am using Pytorch Lightning for the training loop. The network is a simple feed forward with a siamnese branch, and to be exact, the issue only occurs when the cache is enabled.",I found the issue by working on a minimal example. The issue was simply caching the forward pass not including the computation of the loss:  I think we can close this ticket. ^^

I usually try to use the `test_history` tool, but in this case it looks like for some reason it couldn't pick up these examples.","Looking at https://osscirawjobstatus.s3.amazonaws.com/log/4564324852, it seems like an ""Address already in use error"":  ?","Ah, I think they are missing reports because the upload test stats step doesn't get to do the uploading part.

I gave my thoughts on this in those two issues, do those explanations make sense here?  Thanks for the pointers, looking through those two issues it seems like there are two potential reasons for this: 1. This should be avoidable if PyTorch passes a separate port for each multiplexing lane.  2. This might be what's going on here: we're turning up and tearing down connections at such a rate that all ports are unavailable. Regarding 1. can you point to where exactly we pass in this port? Regarding 2., I do feel this does seem to be unlikely since there are 65k ports usually available. "," Although looking at the code here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/tensorpipe_agent.cppL456, it seems like we only pick a default address for UV and not port. If so, I'm assuming the port will always be 0 and the OS should pick one for us. In that case, it is indeed weird that we have an ""Address already in use"" error.","Regarding 1, there's no ""explicit"" ports ever being used by TensorPipe. What happens during these tests is that we might use an explicit port to initialize the TCPStore (or maybe not even that, if we use a FileStore) but, once the store is established and passed to the TensorPipe agent, we only ever create sockets bound on ""automatic"" ports (i.e., a port of 0, which tells the kernel to find a free port, allocate it to us and give us its number) and then the number of this port is inserted into the store so that the clients can read it and use it when connecting. Note that there are two cases in which the listen call can return EADDRINUSE (see https://man7.org/linux/manpages/man2/listen.2.html): either the explicit port number that was requested is occupied, or there are no more automatic port numbers to assign. I suspect we're thus hitting this second case. As for how many ports are actually being used by each test, we can try to estimate it but it's a bit fuzzy. Most tests use 4 ranks (though some use more?) and if they all connect to each other that makes 16 connections (because for each pair the A>B and B>A directions need separate connections). Some (or maybe all?) of these connections might eventually be replaced with a faster backend by TensorPipe (e.g., SHM) but they all ""start"" as TCP during the handshake phase. In fact, depending on which backends are being used, a single TensorPipe pipe might end up using multiple connections (in some cases up to 20, though I don't think this is happening in these tests?). So in the worst case we do indeed get a few hundred connections per test (which might be enough to exhaust the ports) but most likely much fewer. I think there's also the issue that closed connections don't immediately make their port available again. The TCP protocol needs to keep each port in a ""limbo"" for some time to ensure that stray packets that might come in late for the previous connection might not accidentally be delivered to the new owner of a port. I think some of these timeouts are tunable (and I think TensorPipe tries to minimize them?) but not all of them. This means that even if a single test doesn't exhaust the ports, running too many quick tests in a sequence might still do that. Finally there's the issue that we might not really have 65k ports to start with. That's the upper theoretical limit, but it can be lowered in the kernel. You can read the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range` file to know the lower and upper bound of the range of ports that the kernel will use in this automatic assignment. On most baremetal machines I'd say this goes from 4k to 65k (i.e., all of them except some ""reserved"" ports). But I think we're using Docker for our tests and perhaps this limits the number of ports that are made available? Or something along those lines?"
