I was able to replicate this bug with tf.function style and workaround is to use autoclustering.   ! Could you look at this issue. Attached gist in 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and nightly for reference. Thank you!","The function tf.image.extract_patches is not supported on cloud TPU. Check out this link for more information https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tensorflowops  In you autoclustering code, the code fails if we try to set jit_compile=True in model.compile function. Can you elaborate more about the autoclustering code? ","Hi  , XLA have some limitations.At present all the Ops are not compilable with `jit_compile=True`.There are also some known errors as documented here. The error might be probably due to either the Op is not compatible with Jit_compile or the shapes might be dynamic which is not supported by XLA. If you choose auto_clustering then it will automatically chooses from CPU to GPU based on implementation which is not possible with explicit setting in model.compile(jit_compile=True) which forces to use only `jit_compile` and hence throwing the error. Please refer to autoclustering tutorial here. However `autoclustering` too have limitations at present like below as per source. > Note: In TF2, only the code inside `tf.function` will be clustered. > Note: Autoclustering support on CPU and on multiGPU environments is experimental. It seems the shape of the Op `tf.image.extract_patches` is not inferrable at the time of compilation i.e. the output shape of the Op output can't be inferred without actual computation which might happen only during `model.fit()` in this case.Could you cross check and confirm?", Thanks for the explanation. Now it makes sense as to why the error shows up when jit_compile is set to true. However i am not sure how to identify whether the shape of the Op tf.image.extract_patches is inferrable at the time of the compilation or not.  ,"Hi  , If the shape is not inferrable without some computation that may happens during `model.fit()` or say during training step then it is not available for compilation. In our case we can check it by `model.summary()` before `model.compile()`.If we don't get the proper shape(of course batch size might be neglected here since we pass it during training only) may be we can't use `jit_compile` there. Please refer the demo gist for our case.Hope it helps for you and comeback if still needs clarity.

Even if we set constant shape for input layer in this gist (and all shapes in model summary become defined), it still fails with jit_compile=True","As far as i understand, this issue along with https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/59061 come from gradient implementation here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/array_grad.pyL1021","alex , Even if the input shapes are known but if the function output shapes depends upon computation that happening inside the function then jit_compile=True may not work. For example let take the sample code of yours below:  The shape of the variable `outputs` might depends upon the parameters `([1, 16, 16, 1], [1, 8, 8, 1], [1] * 4)` passed in to the Op `tf.image.extract_patches `. Here the shape only inferrable after calling with some input data which do some computation.This computation won't happen during Jit compilation. Hence you may get error. If you can build the model such a way that the output shapes independent of actual computation then jit_compile should work.Please review once again and comeback if anything missing or needs clarification here. Thankyou!", i figured out that issue comes from gradient computation. Here is a fix https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/59185,"alex , Thanks for the PR.Will also keep track on this and let you know once merged.Thanks!","I have validated my comment above.I tried to pass the Inputs with clear input shape `(16, 16, 8)` and model.summary() prints the output shape as `(None, 2, 2, 1)` which means all the shapes are inferrable at the compilation time itself.Please refer attached revised gist.  Hence this problem is not related to shape inference as suspected earlier by me.May be this is valid bug which needs fix.Hoping the above commit by alex fixes this issue.Thanks!",Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue? Yes No,The failed code tested with tfnightly after PR merge and it is running fine without error. Please find the gist here. alex Thanks for your contribution.

After looking through several similar situations it seemed that the XLA_FLAGS environment variable needed to be updated with the location of the cuda installation. It seemed to me that something went wrong with the miniconda tensorflow installation, I couldn't even find the cuda files. So I installed it without miniconda: `sudo apt install nvidiacudatoolkit` but it still didn't work until I updated the ~/.profile file with `export XLA_FLAGS=xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=/usr/lib/cuda/`, which is where the installation ended up, and restarted the session. Then everything worked fine. I'm not sure if it was just me and the process of fiddling trying to fix it but I made a few other changes to my .profile file that may have contributed, so here it is in full. This Ubuntu Linux instance was only setup to run a local session of Google Colab with tensorflow right now. ","Hi  , I have tried to replicate the issue you mentioned in a VM with Ubuntu 20.04, 2 x NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs, x86/64 Architecture and with Venv of TF2.11.Initially i got the same error as mentioned by you.Then i tried `whereis cuda` command and it returns location `cuda: /local/usr/cuda` which is contrast. Then i proceeded with commands as per below attached photographs and the Error is gone. Even though my VM has Ubuntu 20.04 but the Error is same as you mentioned which was  mentioned by you.For me the error was gone and starts working fine when i installed nvidiacudatoolkit in venv.      Could you please refer above details and comeback with your views ?","Tensorflow requires the use of the CUDA library toolkit to be able to utilise the Nvidia's GPUs (`nvidiacudatoolkit`)  also requires the use of Nvidia CUDNN library (`nvidiacudnn`) to run the model under the Tensorflow beginner tutorial `Last updated 20221223 UTC`, at least in Ubuntu 22.04 desktop (`nvidiacudnn`). So that seems to be right.  However, I have noticed that the Ubuntu Official Repository of `nvidiacudatoolkit` installs the CUDA library in `/usr/lib/cuda` whereas if you use Nvidia's Official Repository of `cuda` for Ubuntu and install it through `sudo aptget install cuda` (and to include all GDS packages `sudo aptget install nvidiagds`) the CUDA library will end up in `/usr/local/cuda`.","Hi  , Thanks for confirmation.It seems the behaviour in VM has been different.I will also double check VM behaviour meanwhile with fresh installation.  I assume the behaviour mentioned by you is in Local Linux desktop right? So in your case symlink using `sudo ln s /usr/lib/cuda/ /usr/local/cuda` alone worked for your case ?Whether XLA compilation also works with it or it needs additional `export XLA_FLAGS=xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=/usr/lib/cuda/` setting in `~/.profile `.Could you please test and confirm the same so that it can taken care in documentation or if possible in build config also. Thank you!","Glad for all the help and replies! I would test the following and get back to you. But first, may I ask how do I do XLA compilation?","Hi  , XLA compilation can be done by the setting `jit_compile=True` or `jit_compile='autoclustering'`. For keras models you can pass this argument during `model.compile()` and for custom training loops you can pass it to `tf.function()`.Please note that not all Ops are compatible to XLA. We have also option of autoclustering which automatically does jit_compilation if the Op is available for jit_compile but this is also having limitations and also kind of unpredictable w.r.t behaviour and performance. Please refer to attached resource here and subsequent pages for details about XLA and how to implement it in the code. You may test with minimal code only that might be available  from the tutorials.

The NNAPI compilation caching behavior depends on the capability of the underlying driver. Based on the provided device info (Pixel 3a Android 12), it is likely that the underlying qtigpu driver does not implement compilation caching support.","Thanks for responding to this! I'll try it on other devices and see if I get any benefit. Let me just note that I am using qtidefault on the Pixel 3a (as in, I don't specify the accelerator name), which I think ends up using the qtidsp driver. To check this, I tried specifying qtigpu and there are no log messages regarding cache usage. Startup is very fast (suspiciously fast...), leading me to believe that the delegate isn't correctly applied. The CPUlike performance supports that as well. Specifying qtidsp yields the slow startup but fast inference I laid out in this issue. For the GPU delegate (not through NnApi), compilation provides significant benefit and works fine.","Thanks for the additional info!  Sorry for the confusion. I originally thought you were using qtigpu because you mentioned GPU delegate as well, but it looks like it is actually using qtidsp. (qtigpu is for floating point models and qtidsp is for quantized models) qtidsp should have some level of compilation caching support with sufficient driver version, but pixel 3a may not be a supported device variant. Could you inspect the android logcat to see if there is any useful information? On Android 12, the following logcat message (when compiling the second time) may indicate compilation caching is not supported:  Starting from Android 13, you can expect the following logcat when compilation caching is supported: ","In my actual app I do indeed see   on the second startup. On the first I get a cachemiss as expected. I failed to reproduce that particular message in the code I posted for this issue and couldn't figure out why, so I left it at that since the startup time issue was reliably reproduced. I just borrowed a Pixel 6 Pro from a coworker and checked the logs. I indeed see  during the second startup and it is much faster than the first startup (where I get the obvious cache miss), so this confirms what you said. I think we can close this issue, thank you!"

So how the iterator is stored, because if it is stored as an object (pickle for example) then it is not optimal for storage space (mentioned: Note however that the iterator checkpoints can be large). Compared to my solution, I only need to store/know the seed value to recreate the batches. If the checkpoint only stores seeds or something related optimised for disk space, then I would try to implement it. Secondly, I understand how shuffle works and how the reshuffle_each_iteration parameter affects, however, I want to shuffle my train dataset every epoch and also want to know how shuffle shuffles this dataset every time, so using this parameter doesn't help me (looking at my example https://github.com/WolodjaZ/reproducmltutorial/blob/main/mnist_tensorflow.py ). wt., 17 sty 2023 o 23:23 Andrew Audibert ***@***.***> napisał(a): > The issue with the original repro is that it doesn't set the > reshuffle_each_iteration argument to shuffle > . > By default shuffle will reshuffle, so you get a different order each > iteration. > > You can save dataset iterators into checkpoints > , > so that they can be restored to the exact state. > > — > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub > , > or unsubscribe >  > . > You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: > ***@***.***> >"," Hello, I have been looking into the same subject. What are your current insights on this ? I would love to know. I will shortly experiment with saving the dataset iterator with imagenet training and would give my stats here with and without iterator.","Hi  , Apologies for the delay. Did you checked this comment ? As mentioned the shuffle method has an argument `reshuffle_each_iteration` which is True by default. You need to set it to False explicitly that can probably fixes the issue. Also I have gone through your repo and you have not set any thing to `reshuffle_each_iteration` in `shuffle()`.So by default its doing shuffling and hence changing the dataset order. Setting this argument to `False` might resolve your error. Please check and confirm if still have problems? Thank you!",", okay, I agree that it might work with `reshuffle_each_iteration`. However, what if I want to reshuffle after each iteration (epoch) and still be able to reproduce the iterator state (shuffle order) from the checkpoint? Is this scenario achievable? , after quite some time, I stopped searching for a solution and settled with changing the seed every epoch and explicitly shuffling the dataset with it. Thanks to that approach, you can save the seed and reproduce the state of the iterator from the checkpoint. The code I used","Hi, Thank you for opening this issue. Since this issue has been open for a long time, the code/debug information for this issue may not be relevant with the current state of the code base. The shuffle function uses its own internal seed, which is independent of the global seed set by tf.random.set_seed. The combination of both the global and local seeds determines the final random number generation. The local seed changes with each epoch, but it still interacts with the global seed.

It can cause the TensorFlow error given in the stacktrace if it is not compatible with the version of TensorFlow installed, or if there is a conflict with other versions of TensorFlow installed. _How could this be checked?_ You can check the version of CUDA and cuDNN installed by running the commands: `nvcc version` and `cat /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h`.

You can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable using the command: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64`.

The validation data set is 1/8 the size of the training set.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem reasonable to me to incur even ""only"" a 3.5x performance penalty to process just 12.5% more data. (Actually, it's even worse:  as I mentioned on the Keras ticket, I see the same slowdown even if I reduce the validation dataset size to a single example.

However, when I am using tf.data.dataset window method and my predefined data generator the error occurs. I prefer the second version because I don't need to save a large npy file. So I was wondering why this error will happened in my code. Thanks!"," , without drop_reminder=True the code will not work as we have to tell the TF what to do with reminder data which is lower than the batch size.Best way is to pass `shuffle=True `to `model.fit` which will shuffle the data in each epoch thereby you are not loosing any data from being trained. Also you can use repeat method on the dataset to repeat the data without loosing reminders. Or you can reduce batch size which may not be reccommended."," , Since I am using tf.data.dataset, the shuffle method of model.fit is not working just as what model.fit documentation said ( This argument is ignored when x is a generator or an object of tf.data.Dataset. ).  The point is, why I got the error when running my code? As we know tensorflow will handle the data even if the sample size can not be divided by the batch size.(e.g. I got 500 samples, and my batch size is 64, the training should go well).

For this I can give you some inputs though not a direct Answer to do some analysis from your end.There is a note regarding the argument `drop_reminder` as below.  Also from tf.distribute module the input value should have same rank and shape(except in axis direction).Since you are applying `flat_map()` the shape has only one value and it might be causing problem here.If possible can you construct pipeline without flat_map() and with `drop_reimnder=False` and let us know if it works.  Document Reference Alternatively to avoid loss of data in training you can use repeat() method like below and you can reduce `epochs` value also. `val_dataset = val_dataset.cache().repeat(2).batch(4096*9,drop_remainder=True).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE) ` Please comeback with tested results.

With this PR we are simply trying to return a functionality that was already present and all over the internet you can see the struggle of people trying to solve this problem over and over, the way I see the reason why there's only one tensorflow docker image for tensorflow, tensorboard and tensorflowserve means, you prefer a one stop solution, so if the fix won't be coming to core, it should at least be in the main container image.",The difference is that there is an equivalent of GCS filesystem built internally and both internal and external GCS support is tested nightly. We need to strike a balance between what batteries are included within TF and what we ask the OSS team to support. It is unreasonable for a team of a handful of engineers to support all possible filesystems that exist out there.,"if it comes to having testing, we can also build that, at least for S3 and I'm sure the Azure guys would also be down to adding some testing for their part, that would make a lot of sense if we were do readd it to core tensorflow, do you want us to add tests for this part via a github action?   We can definitively commit to supporting S3 support, we are no strangers to OSS :P ","That would work, I think. but note that I'm no longer in TF, only doing drive by help (and should mostly focus on security stuff only). So I cannot do the decision here. Leaving to  and the team"," Any suggestions as to when this PR will be merged, we have a need to leverage this change ASAP. ","Sorry, I'm still against adding this to the official tensorflow docker containers. It would be expanding the implied support range for something that's already not very maintained to a wider scope, and ultimately wouldn't be a good precedent for us. toplay  FYI","Hi vk, Having software that can be easily changed/updated is key to developer productivity. Additional support can make the code rigid and future upgrades/changes more difficult (due to incompatibilities, etc). A developer who would like to make a change in the software would also have to read and understand a broader scope. Taking into account the maintainability downsides, the proposed PR/change don't seem the best option to me.","Hmm I am somewhat conflicted with this one.  I tend to lean towards what  and toplay have said when it comes to how this ends up expanding implied support.  On the other hand, before joining the TF team i have encountered this scenario in a previous position, so i know it is annoying thing to encounter. (For me it was minio and tensorboard)   My initial question from reading this would be how many other such packages that look to extend the base docker image exist?   Is this truly a one off that we should consider exempting or is it one of many in which we should consider how to better support extending the base images? ",Hi  Can you please resolve conflicts? Thank you!,We are looking to take the docker support in a different direction.

Issue Type Bug  Source binary   we use `pip install` to reproduce the issue although we use `poetry` in production.

We use TF to serve multiple models in production and recently we tried updating from TF 2.8.2 to TF 2.10. We noticed on many of our services/workers there was a memory increase/leak with some services even crashing. We had to revert back to 2.8.2. I also see the issue in TF 2.11. With this deploy in particular the only thing we upgraded was Tensorflow. No application code changes. We monitor the memory with DataDog and all our host graphs showed major spikes. These are mostly `tf.keras` models. I thought originally it was a `ddtrace` issue because from TF 2.9 and up `model.predict` started printing progress bars and I thought all those were getting collected in  DataDog traces. But I set `verbose=0` on all model.predict calls and turned off ddtrace an the issue was still there.

We use TF to serve multiple models in production and recently we tried updating from TF 2.8.2 to TF 2.10. We noticed on many of our services/workers there was a memory increase/leak with some services even crashing. We had to revert back to 2.8.2. I also see the issue in TF 2.11. With this deploy in particular the only thing we upgraded was Tensorflow. No application code changes. We monitor the memory with DataDog and all our host graphs showed major spikes. These are mostly `tf.keras` models. I thought originally it was a `ddtrace` issue because from TF 2.9 and up `model.predict` started printing progress bars and I thought all those were getting collected in  DataDog traces. But I set `verbose=0` on all model.predict calls and turned off ddtrace an the issue was still there.

It's only in TF 2.10 and believe it got introduced in this commit c1286fe88e1.  Its same thing identified by nervana. One workaround in TF 2.10+ is, convert the input array to a TF Dataset for example    This will stop the memory leak.  It has so far only been observed when you pass arrays directly into `model.predict` or to other model APIs (not verified).

Thanks for looking into this. We call model.predict all over our code base in lots of different places with numpy array input and various types of models.

It is correct from 2.11 onwards, we have to rely on TensorflowDirect ML  plugin / Windows Subsystem linux for GPU usage in windows machines. Attached relevant thread  on Tensorflow direct ML  plugin for reference. Thank you!","  Thanks a lot.  I have been compiling and using the latest version of TensorFlow GPU on Windows for several years, which can always have all features supported on Linux, such as AVX2, XLA .etc., and can work well with other components, such as PowerShell, MySQL, Python, Conda .etc. It can even benefit from automatic GPU overclocking on Windows. It may a little bit disappointing that since TF 2.11 onwards, the original Windows Platform will not be supported by TensorFlow GPU.  Anyway, thanks a lot for contributing to TF and making it better and better. Nowadays, I have totally changed to WSL2, compiling and using TF2.11 GPU successfully. In my practice, there may be approximately a 45% performance loss if compared to the one on the original Window. But the cost is still acceptable. WSL2 may always be a lessthancorrect and desirable choice.  Most users choose WSL2 may because some of the codes or components they need are not supported on Windows but are supported on Linux, and, they do not necessarily have two separate platforms. But from my point of view,  for most users, the codes and components they want are actually supported on Windows, it just requires them to invest some time to learn extra Windows operations and maintenance, such as the running mechanisms, the syntax of PowerShell or CMD, and the command line mode of other tools on Windows, and then, they can find a good and easy way to realize the desired codes or components on Windows well. That is, the reason for most users not choosing the Window platform may be to save time, but if the Windows community is also active, users don't need to spend much time. And, if we always use new versions, the activity of the community is not so important. Because people who are willing to try new features are always in the minority, there is a limited amount of experience to refer to. Moreover, from my practice, I found the numbers of unexpected compiling bugs of a new TF version on both Linux and Windows are usually similar, which means the maintenance difficulty is probably similar between Linux and Windows.  Therefore, the sudden nolongersupporting for original Windows is perplexing. Long term, if a user of a machine learning framework uses the Window platform, he/she will be seen as a unicorn. This is unfair because there is always someone who does not have that much money to support two separate platforms, or even three, and as a researcher, the Windows platform is naturally the most economical choice in order to cope with clerical work simultaneously. These people are even willing to spend more time learning Windows operation and maintenance for better usage of the machine learning frameworks but are often discriminated against for ""why don't use Mac and Linux servers?"". Users' choices should not be discriminated against, but unfortunately, this nolongersupporting for original Windows will make Windows users feel more discriminated, even if it is not the official intent. Even though maintaining one more platform will cost more manpower, I still hope the original Windows support will come back.  Thanks again and best wishes.","Hi  ! We are not dropping windows support . You can still use TensorflowCPU in windows machines. It is just that GPU support will be maintained by third party colloborators (Intel, AWS, ARM, linaro etc. ) considering the effort to maintain the integrity and  diversity of Tensorflow framework . Ref You can use TensorflowDirect ML plugin in same windows machine as suggested in previous thread.  (Note: A Windows user myself). Thank you!",", thank you. I have also tried TensorflowDirect ML plugin. Even though it is convenient for its simple configuration, it is still in the development phase with less than complete functionality, such as does not support  XLA, mixed precision .etc.  So, now the situation may be that it is not available in a short term to use the latest version of TensorflowGPU or its equivalent replacement on Windows native platform as same as the original and without performance loss. Hope this 'painful' period will end soon.  Thank you again, and thanks to all TensorFlow contributors/maintainers for your efforts.", ! Thanks for sharing your concern.  ! Could you look at this issue. Thank you!,", Your concerns regarding dropping the TF_GPU support on windows native is well noted and will be escalated to the concern team.But at present it is official from the documentation that: `TensorFlow 2.10 was the last TensorFlow release that supported GPU on nativeWindows. Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, you will need to install TensorFlow in WSL2` and there is little we can do here for now at least.  I am not sure whether Windows native support can be extended in Future versions or not but also can't deny it. It's all based on requirements from community and Tensorflow Team is keenly watching the observations,concerns,inputs from community and may act accordingly. For time being as there is little we can do now shall we close this issue ?  Thankyou!","  Thanks for your detailed information, I will always look forward to a better and widely supported TensorFlow.  And, this issue can be closed.

It's a compiler optimization that actually makes the GPU kernel _slightly_ more accurate.  The GPU kernel is built with FMA enabled by default (generally, not specific to TF):  `fmad=true for nvcc` docs  `ffpcontract=fast` for clang docs The CPU kernel is not built with FMA by default, though you can enable it by specifically enabling fma via compile flag `mfma`. If you explicitly enable FMA in both cases you get the same values (the GPU values you report  mostly  except potentially for some tailend values, depending on how the compiler decides to fuse some operations).  If you explicitly _disable_ FMA in both cases, you get the same values again (but this time the CPU values you report).

(One of my general philosophies for debugging is that it is better to fix something that is wrong than to assume it's irrelevant.) It did not necessarily increase a timeout. I would be surprised if it helped. > TIMEOUT in 3 out of 3 in 300.9s I am not sure what this 5 minute timeout is. My understanding is that these tests have a 1 minute timeout. My guess is that the timeout is in some second layer that is above the tests. (But I could just be confused about something.) One thing that seems to be in common with the failing tests but different than the majority of tests is that they use custom ops in the typical OSS way where each test loads a dynamically linked library that contains the op. I wonder if loading these libraries could be related to the problem?","Hi All, the issue of TIMEOUT is resolved now, by changing the jobs 'jobs' from the Bazel command from 64 to a lower value, I have set it as 16. ","Hi  , Glad that you have found a workaround.I think this might be also related to the memory resources and/or CPU cores. Higher value to the `jobs` argument means higher concurrent jobs. The number of concurrent jobs that Bazel will run is determined not only by the `jobs` setting, but also by Bazel's scheduler, which tries to avoid running concurrent jobs that will use up more resources (RAM or CPU) than are available, based on some (very crude) estimates of the resource consumption of each job. The behavior of the scheduler can be controlled by the `local_ram_resources` option. May be the flag `local_ram_resources` also might have some effect here. WDYT ? Shall we consider this as resolved.

I think I found the issue here . Actually, you are passing a non integer seed in the tf.random.set_seed which is causing the issue. If only integer value are passed in above reproducible code snippets, I can get the expected values. Attached resolved gist for reference. Ref Thank you! ","thanks a lot  for your response. Unfortunately for your first code snippet, you mention it works for you. Indeed it works but if you read carefully my initial comment, if you invoke `f()` several times (without redefining the function), it will give you different random numbers, which is not what we expect, given the `tf.random.set_seed(1)`. That's why in my snippet, I called `f()` twice after the function definition (this was not a typo). I realize I should have RTFM: tf.random.set_seed()'s doc contains much more info than I thought. For a repeatable result calling `f()` several times, there is tf.random.stateless_normal() and other `stateless_xxx()` functions. E.g. this gives the same result for the two invocations of `f()`:  I'm not sure I understand your explanation about `if seeds == (0, 0): `. This is part of the `get_seed()` function and not the `set_seed()` function. But thanks for having taken the time to answer and for the snippets.","Thanks a lot  for your response. Unfortunately I'm afraid the seed I pass is really an integer.   If you add this line:  it'll print `tf.int32` I saw that you replaced `self.seed + repl_id` with just `self.seed` to make the code work.   But that addition `+ repl_id` was intentional: if you only use `self.seed` both replicas will generate the same random numbers. By adding `repl_id` you have a different seed for each replica, but if you rerun the code, those two seeds will remain the same (self.seed + 0 for replica0 and self.seed + 1 for replica1), satisfying the reproducibility requirement. Unfortunately this ends with a `OperatorNotAllowedInGraphError` But thanks for having taken the time to answer, I appreciate it.","Thanks again ,  for your contribution. I searched more and the `stateless_xxx()` functions are the solution. This code satisfies my requirements:  Output:  So with a given seed, the results are reproducible: each replica generates different numbers but a second execution will have the replicas generate the same numbers as with the previous execution. Changing the seed changes completely the sequences as expected. The issue can be closed with the RTFM label if that exists!! Thank you both.","Ok  ! Thanks for the update. Actually, What I meant seed should be a python integer not an integer Tensorflow Tensor. Marking this as resolved from above comment. Thank you!",Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue? Yes No,"  > What I meant seed should be a python integer not an integer Tensorflow Tensor. Actually passing the seed to the tf.function as a tf.constant rather than a python int was intentional. autograph reconstructs a new graph on each invocation with a different python int value. While with a tf.constant, it reuses the same graph. My simplified example doesn't show the input_signatures I use with the tf.function to restrict inputs and ensure only one graph is generated. This wouldn't be serious in my simple example, but in our real (big) model, graph regeneration would take seconds and consume memory. Fortunately `tf.random.stateless_xxx()` solves everything. Thanks for your feedback.","> Unfortunately for your first code snippet, you mention it works for you. Indeed it works but if you read carefully my initial comment Yes sorry is that it seems, without the output, that it was empty. But reading again the ""text"" it is clear. So the pointer to the stateless version is correct. P.s. the autograph problem mentioned for the non stateless impl at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/58433issuecomment1302627410 is still valid."

I have just added some bunch of comments describing the approach. I am new to this source code, so need your handholding for a while. Some questions: 1. Can you share some example code where we have changed the Shape from one dimension to another? 2. Which functions can help me prepend the entries to the multiples shape data structure? 3.

Can you share some example code where we have changed the Shape from one dimension to another? > 2. Which functions can help me prepend the entries to the multiples shape data structure? For the `multiples` data, we don't really expect it to be very big (the max size is governed by the max number of dimensions we support, which is usually around 6 or 7... looks like 7 for this op by scanning below in the tile_ops.cc file for gradients).  This gets passed around as an `ArraySlice` that is created here.  If there is a size mismatch, we can probably just copy this to an `std::vector`, and prepend ones to that. For the input tensor, you will need to use the Eigen tensor `.reshape( )` function.  That accepts an `std::array` (or `Eigen::DSizes` or similar) of new sizes.  Since we need to have a fixed known number of dimensions, you'll need to break it up into cases of output sizes 0  7.  There's an example in `tile_ops_impl.h` that uses `.reshape()`. > 3. Where do I have to write the tests for it? Most tests go through python testing.  Looks like we don't have great testing for `tf.tile` currently. The python tests are generally here for array ops, unless there are a sufficient number of tests for the op to warrant breaking it out into its own file. > 4. Why the above cla/google and AMD ROCm is failing? You should be able to click on the ""Details"" to find out, but it looks like an unrelated configuration error > Package 'pythonpip' has no installation candidate ROCm probably updated their docker images and we haven't caught up.

The issue goes away if built with the full Xcode. (see related comment) Thank you for prompt feedback ! It looks related. The only difference when building with XCode is that the deployment target (or platform version) is actually applied to the final binary, as expected from `—macos_minimum_os=11.0` when built with config `macos_arm64`. That can be confirmed with `dyld_info`. Before, it would have been `12.0` and after it is `11.0`. In my understanding, that disables linker's new “chained fixups format” and the same could be achieved with `linkopt=Wl,no_fixup_chains`. With 12.0 very similar `malformed trie` errors also happen at the runtime when loading (successfully compiled) dynamic libraries from the Python.  (E.g. https://github.com/tensorflow/text/issues/823issuecomment1251596272). What's more cryptic  with 11.0 it would compile&link but would not export the symbols properly (`nm` would list them, but `dyld_info exports` would not) and then just crash the Python process with `SIGBUS`, even with the `lldb` attached, with what looks like some form of OOM on parsing export entries recursively. It seems that XCode 14.x just ships a problematic linker, indeed, as downgrading to commandline tools 13.x (`@()PROGRAM:ld  PROJECT:ld64764`) resolves the issue, even if the deployment target/platform version is still 12.0 🤷","> > Not sure if this issue is related but we have seen `ld: malformed trie` errors when trying to build with Xcode command line tools.

But, is there a plan (or time schedule) to open the APIs for users to directly use GSPMD? For me, it is confusing that GSPMD is supported on Jax but not on TF. Because GSPMD is implemented in XLA, which seems irrelevant of different frontends. I cannot see the technical barriers for TF utilizing GSPMD.","It is already directly usable on TPUs. The codebase I mentioned earlier is an example of using it.  However, I don't work on TensorFlow and am not aware of the progress for GPU APIs. On the other hand, JAX has the same API for all backends.","OK, thanks for the answer  "," , Could you please close the issue, if your issue is resolved.

Totally fine if the decision by Google and/or Apple is no after a certain version. I just want an explicit and transparent notification of this. Thanks.  . This is a good question. Let me provide some context (you might already be familiar or would have guessed). As you mentioned Rosetta doesn't support AVX, so TF built with AVX enabled will have issue which you pointed out. Till TF 2.8 we were building the packages : CC_OPT_FLAGS=""march=core2 Wnosigncompare""  and then we switched to because we were not building the TF base optimally for x86 builds.   CC_OPT_FLAGS=""march=native Wnosigncompare"" In order to be consistent with Tensorflow base builds we switched to using the `native` flag which is akin to `c opt` recommended by Google as well. We have couple of options.  1. Use the native ARM64 builds. Can you please provide reason why you need to use Rosetta and can't use the native builds ?  2. We can add back the `core2` flag which will not be the most optimal build, which I would like to avoid if we can. If there is a compelling reason we can go with option (2). Please let me know your thoughts. ","Thanks for the update. 1. We would love to use native macosx arm64 builds.

So we are stuck using macosx x86 + Rosetta. 2. I thought the whole point of Google and/or Apple creating an entirely new `tensorflowmacos` PyPI package is to provide macosx x86 builds that Rosetta can run?

Is there a way to fix the regression and support Rosetta for already released 2.9.0, 2.9.1, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0? This will be hard. We keep our versions in sync with TF core.

I was able to use Tensorflowmacos wheel after i installed either tensorflowmetal or tensorflowdeps through conda . It worked in few test cases and glitched in some case.

Reopening this issue as requested. Thank you!," thanks for reopening and for the tip. Just to be clear, your suggestion to use `tensorflowmetal` is for Apple silicon native (i.e. arm64) without Rosetta translation, right? And it requires conda and pip packages? Unfortunately, my company currently only uses PyPI instead of conda. So we cannot `conda install c apple tensorflowdeps` according to the Apple doc here. Moreover, even if we did use a hybrid conda + PyPI environment (which isn't recommended), we'd need to first install pip packages since our software depends on `tfx` which pulls in `tensorflow` as a transitive dependency. This is further against the conda doc's recommendations (""Use pip only after conda""). Then we'd need to run `conda install forcereinstall tensorflow=2.9.1` to replace the bad PyPI `tensorflowmacos` with the osxarm64 ones from condaforge. And these condaforge packages are uploaded by usernames like `ngam` and `uwe.korn` whose affiliations with official maintainer teams from Google and Apple are unclear. full conda + pip virtualenv repro steps P.S.

That seems like a viable option for fixing the builds. The main concern about the earlier TF builds is testing and releasing them. We would have to do testing against all 3 python version for x86 and amr64 architectures. Also would have to make sure the Metal plugin builds from the time are working.

This very much looks like RaggedTensors to me  https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/RaggedTensor I'm not sure what the embedding_lookup support for RaggedTensor looks like but if thats available, would that be a viable alternative? ","I don't think ""compressed"" is the right term here.  A ""compressed"" sparse tensor signals to me something like compressed sparse row/column storage.  What we're talking about here is a very special kind of sparse tensor that seems specific to embeddings: (as Rohan mentioned) one which acts more like a ragged tensor. My suggestion is to either try to use RaggedTensor directly, or create a completely new type for this rather than modify `SparseTensor`.","`tf.nn.embedding_lookup` supports the `ids` argument to be a `RaggedTensor`, where all nonzero entries are leftaligned.  See https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/ragged_tensorexample_use_case for an example of using `RaggedTensor` with `embedding_lookup`. `RaggedTensor` also support `GradientTape.gradient` and `custom_gradient`. I would assume the gradient performance of a `RaggedTensor` could be better than a corresponding dense `Tensor` since the number of entries in a `RaggedTensor` is often less than that in a dense `Tensor`.",Thanks for the comments. The idea is to specifically accelerate embedding lookups based on SparseTensors. Existing lookups with RaggedTensors call `embedding_lookup` instead of `embedding_lookup_sparse`/`safe_embedding_lookup_sparse` and appeared to be substantially slower. The “compressed” keyword could be renamed. Introducing an entirely new datatype might be a substantial effort.,"> The “compressed” keyword could be renamed. Introducing an entirely new datatype might be a substantial effort. The issue is it's not _really_ a generic sparse tensor anymore  with ""compressed"" on, it's a severely restricted kind of sparse tensor  one with a very specific structure that really only comes up with embeddings.  You're really trying to squeeze in a different type into the existing `SparseTensor` class.  This should be an embeddingspecific type.","philipphack, thanks for your quick reply. I agree with cantonios on that this is not a generic sparse tensor use case.  Did you look into how slower it is with RaggedTensor or where is the performance bottleneck? I am asking because `embedding_lookup_sparse` also seems to call `embedding_lookup`: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/359c3cdfc5fabac82b3c70b3b6de2b0a8c16874f/tensorflow/python/ops/embedding_ops.pyL521L522 So I assume the slow down is caused by another piece of code. One option here is to improve the performance of `embedding_lookup` with `RaggedTensor`. `RaggedTensor` also provides a `to_sparse` method if the downstream code wants to use `SparseTensor`."," in the current implementation, `embedding_lookup_sparse` does call `embedding_lookup`. However, depending on the value of the `allow_dense_grads` flag, this call (and the preceding unique call) is now avoided.","Slightly off topic since there were discussions over general sparse tensor usage. The sparse tensor input to `embedding_lookup_sparse` only represents sparsity caused by variable hotness (gather different number of rows for each sample), not the sparsity related to embedding. An alternative, and looks much more generic, way is to represent the sp_ids as a sparse matrix that multiply embedding table as matrix. Value can be omitted if combiner is not weighed, and is sp_weight if combiner is weighted. Pytorch's embedding bag follows this fashion, although in more explicit CSR format. I understand that would be a very big incompatible API change, just some thoughts.",Hi  Can you please review this PR ?

Just making Sure things while I am replicating this issue.  For getting a Select ops aar file , TFLite model should involve select ops syntax. Ref Could you use two TF lite model in Bash script (one with Select ops syntax and one with default optimization) .  I also suspect you are using Python 3.6 with TF 2.8 . Could you confirm whether you are using Python 3.7/3.10. Please check in Bazelbin folder once you completed running the script.   Thank you!","Hi   Yes, the model I am using has select tf ops specifically FlexDecodewav. If you see at the logcat of the first cell Python 3.7 is used. Do you want any other detail? Thanks","Hi  ! It is not running the bash script properly and  looks like environment issue from below line. `from tensorflow.python._pywrap_tensorflow_internal import * ` Quick suggestions: 1. clean the previous build ` bazel clean expunge` 2. For 2.8 , You have to checkout with r2.8 branch and build with Bazel 4.2.1 (tested config) .   Could you confirm the machine type too (windows/linux/macos) Thank you!","Hi   The environment is Linux (Colab). I am connecting the colab with a Google Cloud VM instance since this procedure needs much time and high CPU, RAM (Instance is 24 CPUs and 140GB of Ram). I always build with new VM instance so no need of bazel clean up. I will try r2.8 branch and 4.2.1 Bazel and get back to you later. Thanks","Hi   Yes, the code snippet  did the trick! Build completed successfully! By checking out branch r2.8, this forced Baselisk to download and install Bazel version 4.2.1.   Then everything finished OK!

I choosed [this].(https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/androidlibrarypsdaddaarjardependency) I have done this again in the past. What I am noticing during this build with branch 2.8 and Bazel 4.2.1 is that it processes .cpp and . .so files as it was doing with master branch and Bazel 5.3.1. Do you think this has something to do with the issue? Thanks, Also I see that with the 2.8 branch it uses cxxopt='std=c++14' to build the targets inside the build_aar.sh file.  At master branch it has ' cxxopt='std=c++17'',"Ok  ! Thanks for the update. Could you give a try once with the 2.9/2.10 version , Bazel 5.0.0 and procedure mentioned in above comment.

It seems that if you navigate inside the tensorflow_src/tensorflow foder and build with  everything compiles OK and the .aar file works OK inside android. BUT you have to add also tensorflowliteapi.aar file as a dependency from here https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/tensorflow/tensorflowliteapi/2.8.0/.  IMPORTANT you still have to add   if you have a tflite file with TensorFlow ops. The above in this comment does not solve the primary issue which is that I do not get working .aar files with , It seems that with branch r2.8 and configuration  instead of  I have a working tensorflowlite.aar file Now I am waiting for the tensorflowliteselecttfops.aar to verify all together.,Yes  ! You have to skip some flags while doing a selective build . Please update after your test. Thank you!,"Yes  I confirm that I have both .aar files that work fine inside my project! To recap for future developers. I have created a procedure to build tensorflowliteselecttfops.aar with Colab as I think this is easier than building locally with or without Docker. This has the drawback that you need high power CPU colab and you have to switch to Colab Pro or connect your runtime to a Google Cloud Platform VM instance with at least 24 CPUs and 100GBs of RAM. I had to switch to branch r2.8 and install Bazel 4.2.1 to have a successful build. Also for my phone Xiaomi Note 6 Pro I had to build for all artifacts x86,x86_64,arm64v8a,armeabiv7a and not only arm64v8a,armeabiv7a (which still is a mystery for me). The final command was  Now the final .apk is 45MB and used to be 200MB. Also with this procedure you do not have to add the tensorflowliteapi.aar file inside the project.

According to release note, RNG behavior change for `tf.keras.initializers` since `TF 2.10`. In particular, `tf.random.set_seed(seed)` is not enough to get the same model weights  we need to set explicit seeds in the initializers. In general, this is NOT an issue. However, for **testing purpose**, this makes things much more difficult. For example, let's say we have `MyCustomModel`, implemented with layers without specifying any initializer (therefore, no explicit seed with initializer).

As a short cut for now (to have a determined initializer for your test), you can use `tf.keras.utils.set_random_seed()` to set the seed for python/numpy/tf/keras. Hi. I think you misunderstand it. Even set random seed using `tf.keras.utils.set_random_seed()`, the generated weights is different between 2.10 and 2.9/2.8 (Stateless vs Stateful rng)",I see. Is it because there are some golden number that is baked in the test case? (I think TF doesn't have a contract for the exact RNG number created  between version. Adding  for this.),"Yes, we fix some inputs, and use a seed to create models > and test the model outputs will match the predefined expected values. > TF doesn't have a contract for the exact RNG number created between version. I understand  same situation with PyTorch. So far (up to TF 2.9) our tests are fine as we still get the same model weights. But with TF 2.10, some tests are failing. We probably need to reconsider our testing approach, but still wonder if TensorFlow could provide some mechanism to make things much easier 🙏 ","The behavior of the stateless RNG initializers encumbers reproducibility.  As `tf.random.set_seed` no longer affects the initializers, and the only way to have a reproducible initializer is explicit passing a seed at the call site during initialization, there is no easy way to change training runs from using different initial weights to reproducible weights.

Closing this issue now.," I think providing a flag for the switch between stateless and stateful is still necessary. I found the new RNG behavior (same seed, same hardware with deterministic enabled) produced a different result.  Check this link (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/random_numbers). It states, ""The RNG algorithm used by stateless RNGs is devicedependent, meaning the same op running on a different device may produce different outputs."" The same hardware + fixed seed should always generate the same numbers on a different machine. It will be very useful when conducting experiments on the GPU cluster (each time, the cluster may allocate a different machine)."

If 16x8 quantization is not supported for some operators in the model, then the model still can be quantized, but unsupported operators kept in float. The following option should be added to the target_spec to allow this. ` converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.EXPERIMENTAL_TFLITE_BUILTINS_ACTIVATIONS_INT16_WEIGHTS_INT8,tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS]` Attached gist for reference.  Reference Thank you!","Hi .  Thanks for the tip. Keeping those ops in float is better than nothing. At least they don't have weights, so we should be guaranteed that all model parameters are quantized to int8. In our use case, we are developing a compiler backend for TFLite which targets custom hardware.  Like most inference accelerators, it lacks hardware support for floating point, so we would really rather have TFLite code that only consists of fixedpoint ops. We could work around this by doing the float > fixed conversion in our backend, but it seems like TF should be able to do this on its own, and can do it for 8x8 already. So we would like to know if there are any plans to expand 16x8 support, or if it would be open to community contributions.","Actually, looking at the MLIR dialect spec, it seems like some of these ops (for example `tfl.log`) do not support fixed point at all. When I try to compile these in 8x8 mode, I seem to silently get floating points ops instead. Do we always need to allow floating point if we want to use these operators? Or put another way, is full integer quantization supported for only a subset of TFLite?",Ok fs ! Thanks for the update.   ! Could you look at this issue.

I am trying to configure my environment to use these versions of cuBLAS but I am not sure how to go about it. I have searched for a bit now but every time I try one of the suggestions, it seems to break everything and I have to do a clean reinstall of cuda and tensorflow.

Thank you!","At least in the instance of Colab I am getting it is not possible to reproduce because the GPU has more memory than RAM. `nvidiasmi` reports `15109MiB`, while `free h` reports `10G` free. If you have an instance with more RAM, you can run `main(True, False)` or `main(True, True)`, and skip the argparse, which I only added because it is convenient for the CLI. By the way, I tested 2.10, and the problem persists.","Hi , When I was trying to replicating with Tf 2.9 and CUDA 11.4. I got the below error.Please take a look and provide more information.

","But look at the error:  and   On my machine:  It seems to be chocking on running on the GPU itself. It looks like it could not run anything at all. My problem is that GPU vRAM usage depends on the size of the data, which shouldn't matter because we are only sending minibatches. And it is not just for training, inference too:  `main(False)` quickly processes the 15 MiB of data, but `main(False)` runs out of GPU memory because it tries to push the 15 GiB all at once. It should work because I have 30 GiB of RAM. So, `model.predict` and `model.fit` seem to be behaving like their cousins `model.predict_on_batch` and `model.fit_on_batch`, at least when it comes to memory usage.

So being able to convert TF models to TFLite and then to Edge TPU is critical. It seems like this shouldn't be too hard. Please help in anyway possible and don't hesitate to provide any guidance on how to accomplish this goal, such as maybe even directly implementing the models in TFLite or something if possible.

When I don't use enableClassificatin() it goes in the onSuccessListener() shown below otherwise it goes in onFailureListener() shown  in below code snippet.

Could you please take a look at this doc link1 and link2 and let us know whether you are looking for this feature. Thank you!"," , Thank you for the reply. I've been working on getting ParameterServerStrategy working, but am at an impasse.  Since this is bootstrap training, I'd like to have access to each worker's model weights post training; I need to track how parameters are different for each bootstrap split (i.e. a random subsample of the original training data with replacement).  This means that each split should be trained on a separate model replica with the **same initial weights**. Using the chief/worker/param_server model, I do not know whether this means I need a separate worker for *each* split, or whether I can simply define a perworker dataset function that ensures each perworker dataset only trains on a single split.  It's important that the model replicas for each bootstrap split are asynchronous; I need to analyze how the weights change posttraining across all splits. It seems that the only way to do this currently is to fetch perworker model values using a cluster coordinator, possibly with a custom training loop or a callback (if using keras api). I think the perworker `get_weights_fn` would need to return a RemoteValue object, then do something with PerWorkerValues, but I am not sure how to implement it.  Edit: Realized that I was using the term asynchronous incorrectly. What I mean to say is that each worker needs to have a separate parameter server that isn't synced with any of the other workers' parameter servers, which would allow each worker to train its replicas without syncing **at all** with the other workers. So I *think* what I'm describing is a noaggregation scenario, where each worker ""does its own thing"" where pertrainingstep losses are not aggregated across workers. I'll try and visualize what that might look like later. Thanks,","Hi Christian, It sounds to me like you want to train two models, starting from the same weights, on different datasets (that are subsets of the same dataset), and then compare their weights after training. Maybe a naive question, but is this something you can accomplish by simply training these models in two separate jobs? Is the weight comparison used to change how the models will be trained *during* training? If the answer to my naive question is no, then this type of use case could be supported by ParameterServerStrategy, with some customization of ClusterCoordinator. As a sketch: we would schedule closures for each worker using the tagged queues, so that each worker gets its own function to run as a training step, which modifies its own specific model. There are some implications of using the tagged queues, though; for instance for `join` to work as expected we'd have to modify it to wait on these tagged closures to finish (which might cause a small performance hit)","  You're right; I could just train the models on different jobs. It'd be nice to do so in a coordinated way, since I'm trying to run hundreds of models asynchronously, distributed over at least 10 gpu processes running on a single card. Autosharding the data would be nice too, so I thought `distribute` would be a good fit. I was able to get something working with Ray; there's some extra overhead but it'll do. Closing unless anyone wants to discuss further.","  I'm looking to do something similar to what you were trying. I want to train models asynchronously in parallel with some sparse communication between the models after some timesteps. A feature similar to the MirroredStrategy without the ""mirroring"" and aggregation of the gradients would probably be what I'm looking for. Did you ever find a solution?","  Yes, I wrote a script to automate launching training jobs with the ray framework. It launches several worker processes and handles resource allocation, callbacks, etc., works pretty well. Not sure about sparse communication between models; I only needed something that could run multiple models in parallel on different splits in the data. It's basically parallel kfolds CV; none of the models are ""interacting"" to update weights or anything. I'm not sure how to do that with ray."

Unlike in Swift, in Android we dont have the ability to perform any link time optimization since the binary is distributed as a shared object. In the documentation it may be important to distinguish between the compressed and uncompressed file sizes. But also this matches up with what we see in Swift where for arm64, the binary is >=3MB.","Hi, sorry for the late reply. > Yes that would make sense, but then it'd also help in the documentation to specify what architecture and operating system the estimate was made for (android vs. iOS). Sorry the documentation is outdated (the benchmark was done a couple years ago), we are working on updating the documentations. Will update it with new benchmark results. > Is there any reason why the FlexDelegate needs to be linked for iOS (similar question for XNNPack)? Can't they be extras to install like the Metal or CoreML Delegate? Making those two delegates optional would reduce the binary size by nearly 2MB, a near 50% decrease. The TensorFlowLiteC framework doesn't depend on the flex delegate, so the size of tflite::AcquireFlexDelegate() looks suspicious. I'll investigate. The TFLite interpreter uses XNNPack by default if CPU kernels are used as it runs faster. I'll working on the size measurements and see if we can add continuous size watch for TFLite iOS library.","Hi, Thank you for opening this issue.

Tested with `Python3.10` and` Tensorflow 2.9.1` ","Hey , thanks for looking into this. Please note that in my case, the code does execute as well. The traceback I posted under ""relevant log output"" is really a logged message (right after the warning that I mention), not from an exception that reaches my code. Your code logs the same warning  although the reason it gives is different: `Original error: could not get source code`. It appears that you did run the example code from an interactive base interpreter, which apparently prevents AutoGraph from grabbing the source code. Please rerun the code from within a `.py` file or a jupyter notebook, as that seems to provide the source code via a tempfile (that is what I did). Either way, do not expect the code to throw an exception. The issue that I'm reporting here is the warning message both our runs are logging, and the implications: The example code is not being handled by AutoGraph, even though it still can execute.","Any updates here? Still present in TF 2.15.0. Structural pattern matching is part of standard Python and by now several years and python releases old. If AutoGraph cannot handle structural pattern matching, it basically means it is unable to read the python syntax. This is a pity, because pattern matching is very useful, even if it does not involve any tensors. That is, supporting the syntax is important even if the syntax does not unlock any tensor operations. As the feature becomes more wellknown, this will only grow in importance.", I think TensorFlow's AutoGraph may not yet have implemented support for converting this syntax into graph operations.Did u try another approach ?," You think right. AutoGraph does not support structural pattern matching, despite this being a standard python feature since almost three years now (python 3.10 was released in 2021)  that is what I am reporting here.     Each of you were assigned to this at some point, but it seems the issue has now fallen between the cracks. Implementing this shouldn't be too difficult. Judging from previous release schedules, the next TF release may well drop support for python 3.9, at which point basically doesn't support *any* version of python correctly at all anymore!","> Implementing this shouldn't be too difficult. I do see that AutoGraph in fact offers to convert some python control statements into TF graphs. To support that usecase, AutoGraph needs to ""read and understand"" the python AST at some point before running the TF graph (i.e. during the first phase that includes tracing). For example, the documentation states that `if` statements are transformed when the condition is a tensor. The same *could* be done for `match` statements, e.g. by transforming it into an equivalent set of `if` statements. Given the breath of possible matching patterns, this may still be a nonnegligible effort. Instead, I suggest not to support any transformations for `match` at all. IMHO, the majority of usecases for `match` are only relevant during the tracing phase. Therefore, AutoGraph can be fairly oblivious of the existence of `match` at all, just letting it execute normally during tracing. The only reason it causes issues in the first place is likely because AutoGraph needs to inspect the AST to support the transformation of `if`, `while` and `for`, causing it to choke on an unknown AST node. So I'm confident that 99 % of the usecases for `match` could be solved simply by teaching AutoGraph to recognise and (mostly) ignore `match` statements. As it stands today however, all code containing `match` is being rejected entirely by AutoGraph, even if the `match` statement has zero effect on the graph execution phase (apparently even when it appears in the surrounding scope of a definition  see CC(AutoGraph error when function is inside a match ))."

You can check instructions in this document to check available GPU delegate. You can also build your GPU delegate through below Bazel commands.  I am doubtful about NNAPI implementation with Android 5.1 (Android 8.1 minimum requirment). You can check with other available delegate ( I see Snapdragon 616 in Lenovo/A6020a46 , Hexagon delegate might work , not sure though)","Hi , The document you have linked talks about using the delegate through org.tensorflow:tensorflowlitegpu module, while I am inclined with using them through Play Services. TensorFlow Lite available in the Google Play services API doesn't have any way to check if the device is compatible for GPU delegate.","We're not recommending to use the `CompatibilityList` class with TensorFlow Lite in Google Play services, because the list is a static copy built into the SDK, whereas the GPU delegate can get updated over time, so compatibility might actually change. (Also, currently the `CompatibilityList` class is bundled into the static GPU delegate SDK, so depending on it would include a full copy of the GPU delegate implementation, which adds unnecessary binary size).

On the other hand, we think we may have a solution to safeguard the code against this issue in the future, but it would require us to publish an SDK update, which may take a bit."," Any hint on how we can catch it for the time being? We already tried to catch it for TfLiteGpu.isGpuDelegateAvailable(Context) method, still it's throwing exceptions in prod. TfLite.initialize(Context, TfLiteInitializationOptions) is next suspect.","Yeah, the problem is that the exception is being thrown on the UI thread in a callback, not in the immediate call to `isGpuDelegateAvailable()` or `initialize()`, so catching exceptions there won't help.","Got it, thanks for clarification.","Since we haven't been able to reproduce it: do you have any data on how widespread the problem is for your app?

Because TFLite for Play Services overall relies on downloadable APIs/modules, it is possible that just giving it more time may have helped by giving more opportunity for all devices to be uptodate. While the error number going down could be explained by that, I'm still surprised it would go to 0. Either way, we'll probably want to go ahead with an SDK update that handles this situation more gracefully. Couple of thoughts:  is it possible that your app is used on devices that don't have the Play Services? (for example, distributed outside of the Play Store)?  is it possible that some of your users may try to use your app in countries where they would not be able to get Play Services updates/downloads?","We have not distributed this anywhere other than Play Store.

Thanks!," I can run those commands to create the library on Ubuntu, but the result is a library for the CPU architecture that's executing those commands, and not for ARM.","A few months back I successfully used the following commands to build Arm64 libraries with CMake. Give it a try.   N.B. Back then I cloned the master branch, nowadays I would recommend to clone a stable branch (then you know what worked for you, instead of hoping that the master branch still works for you). E.g. `git clone singlebranch branch r2.9 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow tensorflow_src` toolchain_arm64.cmake: ","  Finally had a chance to try it, and worked like a charm for ARM64. Thanks for that :) Then I tried to apply the same method to get the 32bit library, so I changed the toolchain to armlinuxgnueabihf. Looks like XNN doesn't like to be compiled for it. I tried both `arm` and `armhf` as target processor, but in both cases below message was produced:  If I understand it correctly, XNN should be available for ARM EABI HF, right? On another note, it might be worth updating tensorflowlite documentations on how to correctly build the ARM libraries.","Glad you got the Arm64 libraries built. https://github.com/google/XNNPACK/ says about supported architectures: > ARM64 on Android, Linux, macOS, and iOS (including WatchOS and tvOS) > ARMv7 (with NEON) on Android > ARMv6 (with VFPv2) on Linux Strangely enough ARMv6 and ARM64 are mentioned for Linux, but not your ARMv7. You can try to disable Xnnpack during building, e.g. with the CMake macro DTFLITE_ENABLE_XNNPACK=OFF. I'm not sure whether that macro is still respected though, because as you have said correctly, the documentation is outdated.  As for the outdated documentation, you're not the first to mention: https://discuss.tensorflow.org/t/instructionsforcmakeonraspberrypizeroareinaccurate","  Yes that works.

The above mentioned test cases all passed on master branch.,"Hi   , Could you please kindly review this PR? Thank you very much!",Hi KunLu thanks for the fix! Just a quick comment  the official bitcast doc https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/bitcast mentions that there is no data copying so the buffer reuse is a critical requirement. If we wanted to break backwards compatibility then there would have to be an RFC process for it. Is there a need to create a copy of the in buffer for the out buffer  can we not do the transformations on the out buffer?,"Hi  , Thanks so much for your quick reply. If we skip the data swapping on the outer buffer, the result on BE platforms will differ from LE platforms due to different endian orderings. If we reuse the input buffer and keep the data swapping, the content of input buffer will be changed as well. However, we can make a slight adjustment in `cast_ops_test.py` (as shown in the following patch), so that all the above test cases could still pass.  I've also noticed the following note from the documentation: > Note: Bitcast is implemented as a lowlevel cast, so machines with different endian orderings will give different results.  Although the documentation has mentioned that, I think it would be better to make BE machines get the same results as LE machines in these test cases. For example, in test case `//tensorflow/compiler/tests:cast_ops_test_cpu`, I think it's comparing the results between the JIT Compiled XLA Bitcast operation with the basic tensor Bitcast operation, as shown in the code below: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6cd264ba65e6161164d7f1b463b7d2415ac0aeb0/tensorflow/compiler/tests/cast_ops_test.pyL35L47  I found that the JIT Compiled XLA Bitcast operation (`compiled_f()`) will get the same result with Intel (LE platform) on s390x (BE platform), so I wonder if it has used separate input and output buffers, otherwise after the execution of `compiled_f(x)`, the data in `x` would be changed. Since `f(x)` which invokes the basic tensor Bitcast operation will give BE specific result, the original test would fail on s390x. That's the reason why I think we should do the buffer swapping in `tensor.cc` to make the two different versions of Bitcast operation to get the same result, which aligns with Intel platform as well. Please let me know what you think about this issue, thanks again! ",Thanks for your explanation KunLu. Could you please update the documentation at   tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/op/wrappers.go  tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/tensorflow/ir/tf_generated_ops.td  tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api/api_def_Bitcast.pbtxt to indicate the a copy is made on BE machines.,Thanks  !

We can add `tensor_util.h` in there, but now that depends on `tensor_bundle/byte_swap_array.h` and the like, which are in a different package.  This is causing a layering issue.  We shouldn't have `tensorflow/core/framework:tensor` depend on `tensor_bundle` headers. The byte swap headers might need to be moved around, and need to be included in `framework_internal_private_hdrs`.  Maybe move them to `util` and add them there?","Hi  , I have a few questions: 1.

Yes, anything that is reference by something in `framework` needs to be added as a header there.  These may also need to be included in the `mobile_srcs_no_runtime`, but I haven't verified  likely anywhere `tensor.h` is added you will need to add any other headers that it requires.

Are all other tests passing on BE machines?,"Thanks  , Sure. Test case `//tensorflow/compiler/xla/tests:bitcast_convert_test_cpu` uses two XLA backends (HOST/CPU and Interpreter) to execute the `BitcastConvertHloTest`. However, on BE machines these two backends got different results. The HOST backend which lowers the HLO module further to LLVM IR before execution got the identical result to LE machines (such as amd64), while the Interpreter backend which executes the graph with builtin `HloEvaluator` gave BE specific result.  This PR is to swap the buffer to address the endianness issue in this process, it will fix this test case and won't cause any regressions. There are several other test case failures on BE machines which are also caused by the endianness issue, we'll address them in different PRs, such as https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/57060, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/57065 and https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/57069.","Could you provide some rationale for this work? In particular, what the longer term plan for big endian support is. https://github.com/openxla/xla/discussions would be a great place to start a discussion and create more visibility for this effort.","Hi  , Thanks! From my understanding, the rationale behind this issue is that some tensor buffers may contain endian specific data when performing model input/output or serialization/deserialization in TensorFlow code. If the endianness issue isn't taken into consideration, these codes may run correctly on LE platform but fail on BE platform. For example, trying to load a LE specific model data directly on a BE machine would cause error. And for this work, Bitcast operation could not be done in the same way (i.e., direct memory copy) on BE platform as on LE platform. We've contributed several PRs to tensorflow repo to address the endianness issue in model saving/loading process on BE machines, such as CC(Fix Const op tensor_content on s390x during save/load) and CC(Fix swapping of tensor_content when loading a SavedModel on s390x). However, there are still some test case failures caused by the similar issue, especially in the `lite` and `compiler` modules, such as certain `FlatBuffers` related test cases and `quantization` test cases.  Having a holistic solution for endianness issue in TensorFlow code base would be great, but I guess it will take some time. For now I suggest we can fix these issues one by one. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks again.", We are porting TensorFlow code on s390x for each major release and will keep testing on this code.

My first thought was to use Tensorflow Lite to convert it and use it on Android. So I have converted it and I have tried to load it on my computer first (before trying to deploy it on Android). While the `invoke` function of the interpreter is called, it crashes (or the execution is aborted) with no error.   It seems it cannot handle 5D tensor as Oktai15 says but I cannot find any documentation that explains this constraint.

My first thought was to use Tensorflow Lite to convert it and use it on Android. So I have converted it and I have tried to load it on my computer first (before trying to deploy it on Android). While the `invoke` function of the interpreter is called, it crashes (or the execution is aborted) with no error.   It seems it cannot handle 5D tensor as Oktai15 says but I cannot find any documentation that explains this constraint.

Thank you!,"That wasn't a satisfactory solution to this issue for me, because the issue is about how the loss function is actually being calculated. Unless I've seriously misunderstood what 'evaluate' does, I believe we should be able to reproduce *exactly* whatever number is calculated by the 'evaluate' method, completely independently of whatever the network architecture is. The loss is simply a function of the network output, so if I take the network output, whatever the output is, I should be able to calculate the loss for myself.  This does work for other loss functions as far as I can recall, it was just in this particular case with binary crossentropy on a network with more than 1 output that it is producing something that I cannot verify.

Further, `__slots__` for `tf.RaggedTensor` is declared, so adding attributes is not allowed either. This is an issue particularly when saving a model to be promoted into a tf serving environment. When the `SavedModelBuilder` encounters `tf.RaggedTensor` in an input signature it decomposes that ragged tensor into two dense tensors with names like `args_0` and `args_0_1`. If `tf.RaggedTensor` had a name attribute and this was respected by `SavedModelBuilder` serving models with multiple ragged inputs would be easier/possible.","  I was able to replicate the issue reported, please have a look at this gist here.

"," unfortunately not. Spack is a fromsource package manager. We try to build all of our software from source whenever possible. Many of our users are at HPC centers building for esoteric supercomputer architectures like aarch64 and power9 or for the Cray programming environment.

Spack automatically detects the microarchitecture users are building on and injects optimization flags based on compiler version.

But once we solve that, I imagine we'll be back to the original Apple Silicon issue. P.S. The specific line of code giving us trouble was added by google in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/84f40925e929d05e72ab9234e53c729224e3af38, maybe they can comment.","Can you please verify that the actual used protobuf version in bazel is 3.21.x? Note, protobuf has many different occurrences in the build and has a confusing versioning model (it is a very long story why). Basically, protoc (protobuf compiler) used for build is 3.21.9, which corresponds to protobuf runtime (pip python package) 4.21.9. Note, there is no 4.x version for protoc, so  you using `protobuf 4.21.7` suggests me that it points to the pip package. The error message you see (`no such target '//:well_known_types_py_pb2_genproto'`) is comming from `protoc` part, and the fact that this target is missing should mean that you are depending on an older version. The simples way to check the actually resolved version of protoc in your build would be: `bazel run //:protoc  version`",Running:  gives:  This matches the protobuf 3.21.12 (C++) and 4.21.7 (Python) libraries I was expecting.,"Nit: Ideally the major and incremental versions should match (3.21.12 coresponds to 4.21.12). I don't think that causes your problem though. In that case can you build just `//:well_known_types_py_pb2_genproto`?  It must exist, and your error message says it does not. For what it worth, TF builds uses 3.21.9 but again, I do not anticipate differences like that between 3.21.9 and 3.21.12.  Also, can you please check what's inside `/private/var/folders/jv/cgkfvslj6nq1l7cw0c8c_8gm0000gn/T/spackzlw44jee/73416f5c6b515a686e32ac2e3981f9d3/external/com_google_protobuf/version.json`? (the actual path may be different if you rebuilt your project (different hashes for the cache path). For example in my build the `version.json` file looks like the following: ",Built with protobuf 4.21.9 (Python) and 3.21.9 (C++). Running:  gives the same error:  I could not find any `version.info` file anywhere recursively in `/private/var/folders/jv/cgkfvslj6nq1l7cw0c8c_8gm0000gn/T/spackugzi7i1y/_bazel_Adam/f4163c14beee47247db8eb86c7c4a797`.,version.info or version.json?,version.json file should be in the same directory as the `external/com_google_protobuf/BUILD.bazel` build file it complains about in the error message. I basically mean this file: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/version.json The healthy output of `$ bazel build //:well_known_types_py_pb2_genproto` should look like the following: ,"Sorry, I meant `version.json`. The directory in question does not contain this file:  At the moment, I'm just installing the autogenerated tarball from GitHub. Should I instead be checking out the repo and any submodules with git, or does that not matter?","It should be pulled similarly to how TF itself does it: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/workspace2.bzlL455 The patch applied is for python 3.11 support (so it should work on 3.10 python without the patch. `tf_http_archive` is just a wrapper around `http_archive()` with a tf mirror for dependencies, so is also optional. `system_build_file`  that is a legacy irrelevant thing (so does not matter here).",I tried letting bazel download and install its own protobuf during the TF install but that didn't work either. Same error msg as before.,"Bazel does not install protobuf python runtime dependency (if we are talking about protobuf pip package, and which is the one which is supposed to be >= 3.20.3, e.g. this one: https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/4.21.9/). The build just assumes that it is already installed. Our CI makes sure that all the python packages arepreinstalled in the build environment before the build even starts. On the other hand, bazel is responsible for downloading protoc (i.e. generaitontime dependency on protobuf). That one must come from bazel (the way I described in my previous comment). The build does not really have a chance to work otherwise. So i'm confused.  What exactly is your build environment? How exactly is protoc and protobuf pypi package are supplied to your build environment? If inside your bazel cache directory (`external/com_google_protobuf`) there are only a few files, then something is fundamentally wrong with your setup. This is how that cached dir supposed to look like:  Please do not try to build it by providing protoc in some custom way, as it will most likely give you a lot of frustration, and even if you manage to build it that way, it will super likely break again on any significant update on TF/proto side anyways.","Progress! I started removing components from our build system one by one and discovered a:  environment variable that was the culprit! This was introduced way back in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/16258 in order to allow us to build against externally installed protobuf to solve a different issue with horovod. Removing it probably breaks horovod, but let's ignore that for now. This gets me to a new error:  Full build log: spackbuildout.txt > What exactly is your build environment? I'm a developer for the Spack package manager. We have a rather complex build recipe for TF and its dependencies. In https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/36263, I'm attempting to update this build recipe with the latest versions of TF. That's when we encountered this issue. I realize that your team might not be interested in supporting ""yet another package manager"", but Spack is pretty much the de facto package manager in use at every national lab and HPC center around the world. We have a lot of unique needs (aarch64 and ppc64le support, airgapped networks that prevent downloading dependencies, security requirements, etc.) that make our build recipes quite complex. If anyone from the build team would be willing to help us maintain these recipes we would be eternally grateful.","This bug needs to change its name. It is formulated as a generic build issue on Apple M1/M2 architecture, when it turns out to be a build issue in a completely custom environment for an independent (Spack) product. To be completely honest, this bug needs to be in Spack's repository, not TF repository. I do understand and can relate to the importance of Spack and you trying to make new TF work there. It is also beneficial to TF as a project to be available in as many places as possible, so thank you for doing it. The problem for us is that we don't have enough resources to properly support even the platforms that Google officially declares to support.  For the current clang error you have  the message seems to be quite self explanatory (not the case for most build errors we get here...). I don't know where exactly that option comes from, but I would search for it in both TF and your custom env. Also please make sure that the version of clang  you are using is a correct one. Unfortunately I can't suggest much here as Mac is literally the platform I know the least about (never even owned a single Apple product in my entire life).  "," is `mcpu=vortex` something Spack's compiler wrappers might be injecting? I see no mention of `vortex` in either TF or in our build recipe. I was hoping to frame this issue in a generic ""I'm having trouble building TF from source"" kind of way. If there is documentation for the recommended way to build TF from source on macOS I'm happy to follow that outside of Spack and see if I hit the same issue. I can handle any of the intricacies of Spack if I can manage to get TF to build from source outside of Spack.",Hey! Also interested in this issue. It turns out that no prebuilt wheel is available for `macos` with `arm64` right now on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/files Do you know if the CI for `macos` under `arm64` is running?," Yes, unfortunately. This is going to change soon, but to give some context:  We added the flag here https://github.com/archspec/archspecjson/pull/55issuecomment1276552320, when adding initial support for M2  The flag as been reported wrong later, see https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/36481  This will be fixed soon in `archspec` and ported to Spack in `develop` and v0.19.3 It seems that people reporting `mcpu=vortex` and `mcpu=cyclone` etc. are using clang from `homebrew`, while latest AppleClang is moving towards the ""saner"" `mcpu=applem2`.","Also, this issue should be specific with Apple M2. For Apple M1 the flag has been stable since a while `mcpu=applem1`.",Thanks for the fix ! This gets me further through the build before a new failure:  Full build log is too large to upload here.,"We managed to make it through the protobuf issues, but now I'm back to the issue from CC(Build error: Exec failed due to IOException: xcrun failed with code 1.):  Not sure if this is relevant, but I have the following set: ","Managed to get 2.13.0 to build from source with the help of https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/60179issuecomment1491238631.

Proper image processing through augmentation. ( Keras image generator, or layer.augmentation) 3.

On the GPU, you can't use the same tensor (underlying implementation is GPU texture) twice or more.  Thus, PACK(a, a) doesn't really work.  If you really want, you have to create a temporary variable and do something like PACK(a, b) where b = ADD(a, 1e12) (maybe 0 also works).

Yes No, Wanted to see if there was any update here because I am seeing the same issue with tensorflow 2.10.0 I am running tensorflow lite version 2.10.0 and for a native C++ object detection app and getting similar issues when running on the GPU with not only a custom model but a model downloaded straight from the TF2 model zoo. I have followed the instructions of taking any of the ssd models (mostly the mobilenet models) and running the export script for tf2 and then using python tf converter to create the model.tflite file.  The tflite model that doesn't given me those pack or reshape errors is the mobilenet_v1 tflite model (with metadata) downloaded from the tfhub site. Are there any steps to create a .tflite model for object detection on tensorflow 2.10.0 where the pack and reshape issues don't come up and most operations run on the GPU?,Please reopen this ticket as the issue is still present, I don't know enough about TF 2.10 or the converter.  Can this be assigned to the owner of TFLite convert?,"Not sure if this helps give a direction to look for the issue, but I found it one modifies the default pretrained config file (I was using mobilenetV2) and you change the following area to look like this: `     anchor_generator {       multiscale_anchor_generator {         min_level: 3         max_level: 3         anchor_scale: 4.0         aspect_ratios: 1.0         aspect_ratios: 2.0         aspect_ratios: 0.5         scales_per_octave: 2       }     } ` i.e change the max_level from 7 to 3 and you change  The fpn info to look like the following: `  fpn {         min_level: 3         max_level: 3         additional_layer_depth: 128 } ` i.e. change max level from 7 to 3 it didn't give me those errors and in c++ i ended up with the following GPU delegate output: ` Setting up GPU Delegate Created!

Just asking because I switched back to a commit for the models repo that was back around the time of tensorflow 2.5.0 thinking this would make things work and was seeing about the same issue. Only difference was that the model that was created and then exported to a .tflite file always seemed to run everything on the GPU except the last output layer where as in 2.10.0 it always seemed to split things between the gpu and cpu.,So found out that downgrading to cura 11.2 and cudnn8.101 does resolve the issues. Any thoughts?,"   I think I have found the issue. It appears that in the first version of the the export_tflite_ssd_graph.py it called the export_tflite_ssd_graph_lib.py which and a pruning of the h_stack and w_stack tensors that had the shapes I mentioned above. The export_tflite_graph_lib_tf2.py doesn't seem to have this. I modifyed the ops.py file found in the models repo (models/research/object_detection/utils/ops.py) so that the nearest_neighbor_upsampling function which was causing the problem looked like the following:  My question here is, doing a tf.concat the same as doing a tf.stack and then a tf.reshape? Also I noticed that the docstring states talks about being TPU compatible, so is what i did above TPU compatable?",  any thoughts on this???,"Hi, Thank you for opening this issue.

Yeah I've gotten the JAX fft to work using jax2tf.convert, but it is not able to be serialized into a protobuf (falls back to EigenFFT), so it's only usable in a python environment.  Do you know if there are currently any plans to integrate PocketFFT into tensorflow?",Eigen can use PocketFFT if we include the pocketfft header (`pcketfft_hdronly.h`) in tensorflow and define `EIGEN_POCKETFFT_DEFAULT=1`.  That was added in !356.  We'd probably be willing to accept a pullrequest to enable it. The header would need to be pulled in under `third_party` (similar to the relevant JAX change in 4699.,"Hey , thanks for your reply.  Do you know if that's all that would be needed? If so, that sounds like a very quick change for something that would give immense benefit to the community for many use cases that require STFT transformations in a Tensorflow model inference pipeline.  If one wants to deploy a Tensorflow model in C++ on a CPU that operates on STFTs, they're forced to implement the STFT in C++ and feed that data into Tensorflow, otherwise you face a 3x performance hit. The problem gets immensely more complicated when the STFT transformations are in the _middle_ of a TF inference pipeline. I haven't been involved in contributing to Tensorflow in the past, so I would likely need to invest quite some time to learning the build system to do it myself. I'm currently swamped with high priority work before a going on vacation, so won't have the time to do so any time soon.  Is this something someone at Google could quickly try to implement, given the huge benefit it would provide?  Based off of this issue, it's a highly requested feature, as expected considering how widely used FFTs are in ML (speech, music, video, imaging, etc).","Looks like JAX switched to ducc (which is an ""evolution"" of pocketfft written by the same author).  We may consider the same.  it's not high priority for anyone on our end because we typically do model serving with GPU/TPU.  I've asked around, as well as the JAX team about their experience.  Depending on what I hear back, I _may_ put it on my list, though again it would be near the bottom of my priority queue.  If anyone else here is interested, I'm happy to look at PRs.","Looks like the PocketFFT author now recommends using DUCC, and the JAX team is happy with the transition, so we should do the same."," Awesome!

Unless you can guarantee C++17 support on all target platforms, you may want to use pocketfft, but if this is not an issue, I strongly recommend DUCC. Thanks  ! C++17 isn't an issue  TF now requires c++17 anyways.  I think the main blockers are: 1) We can't actually use `std::mutex` or `std::thread` directly in TF (or internally, at all, within Google) 2) We would like to be able to use TF's threadpool for `execParallel(...)` For JAX, we initially simply set `DUCC0_NO_THREADING`.  However, we later found that we ran into race conditions in the `get_plan` cache due to parallel FFTs.  We _could_ disable plan caching as well, but I'm not sure how negatively that would impact performance.  We should solve this before adding it to TF. I _think_ we can work around this with minor modifications to `ducc0`: add optional inputs with defaults for the parallelizer and plan cache.  I haven't looked into it too closely.  How open would you be to modifications like this?","> We could disable plan caching as well, but I'm not sure how negatively that would impact performance. Actually that should not be a problem at all ... unless someone is calling 1D FFTs of length 10 over and over :) If you have lengths above, say, 256, or multiD transforms, plan caching isn't an issue. > I think we can work around this with minor modifications to ducc0: add optional inputs with defaults for the parallelizer and plan cache. I haven't looked into it too closely. How open would you be to modifications like this? I'd have to see the changes to judge this. Can you point me to a code location where you do something equivalent to `ducc`'s `execParallel`?","> Actually that should not be a problem at all ... unless someone is calling 1D FFTs of length 10 over and over :) We have people doing many batches of small FFTs.  For example, we have an internal TF user that ran into an issue with cuFFT that was doing millions of training iterations, each computing 10k batches of 16x16 2D FFTs.

We would probably need something like:  The defaults would be simple structs that call `execParallel(...)` and `get_plan(...)` directly, but for TF's usage we would pass in our own versions that use TF's threadpool, and our own threadsafe caching mechanism.","> We have people doing many batches of small FFTs. For example, we have an internal TF user that ran into an issue with cuFFT that was doing millions of training iterations, each computing 10k batches of 16x16 2D FFTs. If the 10k FFTs are done in a single call (i.e. you call with a 3D array, but transform only along two axes), then plan caching is irrelevant. The plan for a singe length16 FFT will be computed once at the start, and the cost for this is negligible compared to the actual transforms. (And even if the 16x16 transforms are called individually, the plan will be reused 32 times, so that the actual FFT dominates). It's important to realize that pocketfft plans are much faster to compute than even FFTW's FFTW_ESTIMATE plans. That said, if performance of 16x16 FFTs is really important for an application, I'd look into customgenerated transforms for exactly this size... they can be *much* faster than any general purpose approach. > What was the motivation for implementing the `get_plan LRU` cache, and do you think it would apply here? This mainly exists because `scipy` people wanted to have it. I even have a PR against `scipy` (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/12307) which would have disabled it because it can cause too much memory consumption in edge cases. This is no longer a problem with the current `ducc` version, but I still don't see real benefit in it. Thanks for the code snippet! I'm sure we can work something out if necessary. BTW, we can work on a potential solution for this on https://github.com/mreineck/ducc; it should be easier to collaborate there than on the Gitlab instance where I have my master repo.","> This mainly exists because scipy people wanted to have it....

You can also refer quantization documentation to improve the performance .Thank you!,"Hi, ! ""Approximately same"" is like ""almost jumped across an abyss"". It doesn't work that way :) The results are either equal or not equal.  Actually, it means that the model results are either reproducible across different supported platforms, or they are not. Unless it is not explicitly told otherwise in the documentation, it is reasonable to suppose that normal behaviour is to get the same results on the same inputs using the same model.

I tried to follow the blame back as far as I could, but it looks like this function's history extends longer than the record visible in this repository, and there has never been a rationale given in the source code for this behavior. It seems like the `execute()` helper should probably use the `return_code` of the process to work out if the invoked process succeeded. If there isn't a specific reason to ignore the return code and focus on the content of the streams, I am willing to write a PR for the necessary changes.","Alternatively, here is a patch that fixes **only** the failure reported in this issue, leaving the fairly antisocial behavior of `execute()` alone and fixing only some of the places that Python warnings can cause failures (I'm sure there are others): ", Could you refer to the tested build configurations and try with the latest TF version 2.9.0.

I am however quite confident that this issue is present in 2.9.0 and the current `HEAD` of the repository, because the issue is that the `execute()` function treats stderr writes as fatal errors, and this is going to cause a lot of artificial failures with misleading error messages. More specifically to the reported reproduction, any project that uses Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.9.0 and `distutils` is going to cause the `DeprecationWarning` that is causing the Python configuration step to fail.","Hi  , Could you please confirm if this is still an issue ?

Thanks! The code responsible for this bug has not changed since I filed my report, this bug is still present in TensorFlow's build system. To reproduce the bug, any build that includes a write to `stderr` from something called by the `execute()` function will trigger the bug. I am afraid I do not have time to put more effort into updating the reproducer I attached to this issue, but a good way to do that would be to add an extra call to `execute()` that echos something to `stderr`, which should be enough to trigger the faulty behavior.","Hi, Thank you for opening this issue.

Thank you!","What is the purpose of defining a separate `dataset_B` instead of just applying `.map(mapfunc)` to `dataset_A`?  Creating and checkpointing a single dataset/iterator should fix the issue. Right now you're creating two iterators (one for `dataset_A` and one for `dataset_B`) but only checkpointing the iterator for `dataset_A`. Even if you checkpointed both iterators, there would still be a race condition between checkpointing the iterators and transferring data from one iterator to the other.","  Because I need to use `tf.py_function`  in .map(mapfunc) and save an  `dataset`'s iter state, as the sample codes above. But its can not be saved, since dataset guidline.  So,  cascading `dataset` (saving previous `daraset` and putting `.map(mapfunc)` in posterior  `daraset` ) is the only way that I can figure out within my ability. But the problem is, it works only `tf.config.experimental.enable_op_determinism()` is used as precondition.😊","Thanks!      I find an easier way to traceback dataset from checkpoint and without cascade 2 tf.data.dataset. After all, my needs and problems are too rare.   Any way, thank you very much.

At the end it turned out to be a Mac OS GPU problem. I was using the GPU chip of my M1 chip and this somehow produced the weird results above. After switching to CPU it works just fine. Not a big issue for me as we train our models on SageMaker anyhow. Thanks a lot for your help anyways! Best regards!, Thank you for the update!

Your target function $f(x_1, x_2) \equiv cos(x_1) + x_2 / 5$ is a smooth surface over $\mathbb{R}^2$ which has a constant slope of 0.2 along the $x_2$ direction and is wavy along the $x_1$ direction.  You are training a network to fit just a slice of points along the line $x_1 = x_2$ from 0 to 100000.  So, even if `model()` learns to fit all the values along this line, it has a lot of freedom in the shape of the actual surface itself, so it is not surprising that it has learned a totally different surface. If you instead train it to fit points spread out in the whole square $0 \le x_1, x_2 \le 100000$, then it's likely that `model()` will have gradients much closer to the target function.",", Could you please take a look at this comment from the user and let us know if it still an issue.

To use the library properly, you need to create a CMake project. Please refer the ""Create a CMake project which uses TensorFlow Lite"" section. Unfortunately my project is not based on cmake and so I really only see 4 ways to link to tflite at this point: 1. Convert to CMake (not feasible) 2. Create a CMake library project that wraps tflite and produces one single static library that can be linked from my noncmake project (feasible but a major PITA 3. Ask niceely for tf to support non cmake projects (probably not going to happen) 4. Hack the hell out of this and just make it work™ In the interest of saving time and not wasting my brilliance on this stuff I went wit option 4. Here is the workaround if you find yourself in a similar situation; To get additional lib folders ( use with L during link) find . type f name ""*.a"" exec  dirname {} \; | sort u To get the list of lib files (use with l during link) find . type f name ""lib*.a"" exec  basename {} \; NOTE: you have to remove ""lib"" prefix and "".a"" suffix for this to work The final result for me (Qt6 qmake

The above error is pointing towards unavailability of SDK tool chain and NDK tool chain during the build process(./configure). If you already have Android studio installed , it will take an existing tool chain from respective folders  else you can download NDK (19 min version)and SDK tool (23 min version )chain and export the path before running build process.  Alternatively you can follow the below process. 0. install Bazel 5.0.0 in macos  1. git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow 2. cd tensorflow 3. git checkout r2.9 4. ./configure or python configure.py 5. say yes to android build when it asks and set path to SDK and NDK. 6. bazelisk build c opt fat_apk_cpu=x86,x86_64,arm64v8a,armeabiv7a \   host_crosstool_top=//tools/cpp:toolchain \   //tensorflow/lite/java:tensorflowlite Could you close the issue CC(Unable to use tflite java on macos) if duplicate to this issue. Thank you!",Thanks  . I went through `./configure` again and realized that I had an older version  than the default minimum  android SDK installed (32). I installed 32.0.0 and 32.1.0rc1 and ran into the error `missing input file 'external/androidsdk/buildtools/32.0.0/lib/dx.jar'`. I then installed SDK version 30.0.3 and went through the configuration again to use it and after that I was able to build the target successfully. This isn't a duplicate of CC(Unable to use tflite java on macos) as that's more about us getting jni errors when we try to use tflitejava from maven in local unit testing.

There's isn't a good way to determine how much data a given generator will produce.  The generator could be infinite or produce random amounts of data. Thank you!"," Thank you for the quick response.  So, just to make sure  it is not expected that `shard` will work correctly for datasets generated by `Dataset.from_generator()`? Could you then maybe imagine a way of feeding a dataset from a Queue which contigously supplies images where the cardinality is not unknown?  The final amount of images the Queue will deliver could be known but the data will be only available during runtime. This excludes defining the dataset by something like `from_tensors()`, doesn't it? Thanks for the help!",", I was able to reproduce the issue on tensorflow v2.8, v2.9 and nightly. Kindly find the gist of it here.","The official docs for `shard` say > Creates a Dataset that includes only 1/num_shards of this dataset. > > shard is deterministic. The Dataset produced by A.shard(n, i) will contain all elements of A whose index mod n = i. Shard doesn't partition a dataset  rather it reads all the elements from the dataset and drops all but  `1/num_shards` of them. `shard` may be used to partition a dataset **if the dataset can be deterministically iterated through multiple times**. Each `.shard(num_shards, i)` transformation will read its entire input dataset and return only the part of the dataset that belongs to the specified ""shard"". In your case, the dataset created by `from_generator` is not deterministic since all iterations share the same Queue. That is why shard isn't working as you expected. Your workaround is reasonable and I wouldn't expect it to add a detectable amount of overhead. Alternatively, you could consider using a single (unsharded) dataset, and having prediction instances all pull from the same iterator over that dataset. That would result in processing every element exactly once, though it wouldn't be deterministic which thread processes which element. ","Thank you for the good explanations. I think I slightly unterstood the idea.  In my mind `shard` would have partitioning the dataset by kind of a counter logic or something like that. Reading all elements first actually seems unintuitive to me. I guess there could be a couple of methods more not working as expected on non deterministic datasets, like `concatenate`. I can imagine that cases like this are common pitfalls for developers and believe now that non deterministic datasets are kind of restricted. Maybe if there aren't some cases where this behaviour could be required, some warnings/errors could help here. In the minimal example I don't expect a detectable overhead by the workaround either. In my real application I put back the prediction data into datasets. My entire datapipeline uses `as_numpy_iterator()` and `from_generator()` about 10 times or so and I once read instanciation of `Dataset` is quite some overhead. Your example seems to be usefull to optimize througput. I'll keep that in mind.  I have 4 parallel instances each expecting to get elements with their indices (03) from the queue. My newest approach is to get the 4 elements zipped and run the prediction mapping a numpy_function wrapping the model prediction. This saves me all those custom 'cuts' and right now seems to perform better than the Thread/Queue approaches.   I have no idea if and how AUTOTUNE takes any effect here. The single prediction instances are getting very unbalanced workload (1/12/48). But I think it doesn't really matter, since I have to gather the 4 prediction results for postprocessing anyway. Anyway, thanks a lot for the help and for resolving my issue!",Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue? Yes No

The issue can be reproduced during thread pool destruction with threadlocal TraceMeRecorder::ThreadLocalRecorderWrapper used in each thread. After adding logs into nsync library, we are able to identify the root cause.  Root cause Destruction order of threadlocal variables is not deterministic in POSIX. Mutex or conditional variable in TensorFlow is a thread local object.

At this moment, the other thread 0x7f4100718700 enter and take the waiter from free_waiters. Then, the old thread 0x7f4118748700 tries to take a lock again as the other threadlocal object use a lock in its destructor.

The issue can be reproduced during thread pool destruction with threadlocal TraceMeRecorder::ThreadLocalRecorderWrapper used in each thread. After adding logs into nsync library, we are able to identify the root cause.  Root cause Destruction order of threadlocal variables is not deterministic in POSIX. Mutex or conditional variable in TensorFlow is a thread local object. If another thread local object e.g. perthread TraceMe recorder use a lock in its destructor, the lock can already be destructed and the behavior is undefined.  Details For example, the following logs show two threads(0x7f4118748700 and 0x7f4100718700) share the same nsync waiter object (0x7f465c2c2290) and cause SIGSEGV. A nsync waiter object is a thread local object used by nsync to implement a lock. First, the waiter_destroy i.e. lock destructor was called on thread 0x7f4118748700 and the waiter 0x7f465c2c2290 had been recycled into free_waiters. At this moment, the other thread 0x7f4100718700 enter and take the waiter from free_waiters. Then, the old thread 0x7f4118748700 tries to take a lock again as the other threadlocal object use a lock in its destructor. Because the threadlocal state is not cleaned u",2022-05-26T21:07:09Z,type:bug comp:core TF 2.4 awaiting PR merge,closed,1,8,https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/56280,", In order to expedite the troubleshooting process, could you provide the complete code to reproduce the issue reported here.

Trying to make Python input processing with `from_generator` as performant as C++ processing is going to be an uphill battle.   I used tf.data.TFRecordDataset, however, the writingtofile process is not scaling up well. I tried to write 400k samples into a TFRecord file, which took me a couple of minutes. However, when I wrote 40 million samples, It took me around 10 hours. I think that there is a problem with the way tf.io.TFRecordWriter is writing. We cannot control the buffer which determines when to perform disk access  meaning that I do not know how to write in bulks of specific size. Note that this is my assumption for not being able to scale up well.","It might help to write to multiple files in parallel.

If you use Dataset.save/Dataset.load, it will automatically parallelize the writing for you.   This is indeed one option; however, it seems that even without parallelizing the process, the execution time should be linear as a function of the number of samples, but it is not linear. Therefore, I assume that the bottleneck is the number of disk access that costs too much. If that is the problem, I think that allowing to write to disk in bulks will improve the execution time significantly (and control the bulk/buffer size). It might be that I'm wrong, and it already writes in bulks, but I'm not familiar with the interior implementation. Thank you"," I did a little test. This is part of my code (I know that each time I overwrite the file repeatedly). I followed the file size during the process and found that the increase in size in each update is very small (probably less than MB). This confirms what I thought, and the bottleneck is in the number of times `tf.data.experimental.TFRecordWriter` writes. This is also the case with `tf.io.TFRecordWriter`.

Yes thanks I think that it is something important to repeat as many things that it is just an approximation to make things faster (fooled by the `optimizer` name).  But also this is the 2nd time in a week and I have seen many of these in my sparse triage activity over the years.  So probably it is time to find a place to better better promote this knowledge. If an users/developer have some doubt I think it could be ok to test:  I don't know if we could have numerical bugs in these optimizations but eventually It would be very hard that we have this kind of report by users.","Right, so that's my point  the optimizations should never be approximating. It's more like transformations of the kind `exp(log(x)) > x`, or `3 * x / x > 3`. So if we see discrepancies, it's likely that the eager code is numerically unstable, whereas the optimized code is more correct. That's why disabling the optimizer should only be used for testing."

Please try with the latest TF v2.8.0  and let us know if it helps ?  Thank you!, I will try but the cluster I'm working with has Bazel v3.7.2 as the latest version. I'll try and update the Bazel version and build Tensorflow v2.8.0. The issue seems that my cuDNN library files are not under the CUDA directory `/usr/local/easybuild/software/CUDA/11.3.1` but rather at `/usr/local/easybuild/software/cuDNN/8.2.1.32CUDA11.3.1`. I do not have `sudo` access to create symlinks but maybe the newer bazel version and the newer tensorflow version will solve this issue.," Tried with Bazel v5.1.1 insalled through bazelisk with the latest tf version obtained from github through a `git clone` and no `git checkout` and it still is the same issue. Because cuDNN libraries are in a different directory, the configuration script fails to find the cuDNN libraries and the `cudnn.h` file. I have added all the relevant paths to my `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and my `$PATH` in my `~/.bashrc` file and sourced it to no avail. As a note, I am able to build the latest `jax` and `jaxlib` versions on this system without any issues so it seems the issue is that `configure.py` and `configure.cmd` are only able to look for cudnn files under `.../CUDA/11.3.1` even though I supply the correct path when prompted. Here is an example configure step:  The paths to CUDA and cuDNN for me are: for CUDA: /usr/local/easybuild/software/CUDA/11.3.1/ for cuDNN: /usr/local/easybuild/software/cuDNN/8.2.1.32CUDA11.3.1/ for NCCL: /usr/local/easybuild/software/NCCL/2.10.3GCCcore10.3.0CUDA11.3.1 I do not have `sudo` access to create a symlink or anything similar. Any help would be appreciated.","I figured it out. Here is how I did it:  With the `export` statement, `configure.py` was able to automatically locate CUDA, cuDNN and NCCL libraries and the build completed successfully.  It might not be a bad idea to update the official instructions as I'm guessing this is an issue for other people working with remote clusters configured with easybuild.",", Glad that this issue is resolved. `export` statement is already available in GPU support doc. Please take a look at this link. Thank you! `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64`", My `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable already contains the relevant paths for cuDNN and CUDA libraries but for some reason `configure` fails to find them. `export TF_CUDA_PATH` was more reliable for me for some reason but thanks for the link.,"Hi , Since the issue is resolved can we move this to closed status.

This only happens for the `for_stmt` operator, which passes the iterate as an argument. If we rewrite the test as a while loop, so that `i` is closedver by the function body, things are once again quirky as intended:  This means that the fix is also to avoid passing the iterate as argument to the loop body, and instead rely on the `get_state`/`set_state` functions, as is the case of the while loop.","Yes is what I have suspected:   And modify your while example to correctly get the output we ""expect"":  ", I've manually rewritten the transformation output. Do we need to produce something like this for the `lambda:` case? ,"Yes, something like that. And then the loop_body function would be a regular thunk: `def loop_body():`. We may also need to initialize `i` with Undefined, rather than 0, and might also need to replace `(), {'iterate_names': 'i'}` with just `('i',)`, but not sure.",Do we want to handle `iter` as `nolocal`?

Those are managed / downloaded by gradle dependency `implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflowlitehexagon:0.0.0nightlySNAPSHOT'` so probably your apps are still using the cached libs that are downloaded before the new release. Instructions for verifying if your libs are up to date is in this comment.

Our `tf.image` toolbox is designed for 2D images, and does an interpolation or convolution (depending on the supplied method).  A generalized 3D image resize primitive would mirror this, and apply the interpolation/convolution in all 3 dimensions.  Is this what you're looking for? In MR images, the zdirection usually has a much lower resolution that the others, and correlation between slices is much lower (since slices have further separation and have larger ""thickness"").   You often don't want to interpolate between these.  More commonly, you resize the 2D image slices and then stack them together, as you have done (i.e. only resize in xy).  To reduce the number of slices, you can either pick a region of interest (e.g. choose the middle 10 slices as in your workaround), or use `tf.strided_slice` to skip between them (e.g. `a5 = a4[...,  ::2, :]`). If you're content with your workaround, I don't think we could squeeze much more efficiency out of it by introducing a new op.  In graph mode, the shaperesizeshape will be just as efficient as if we had done the same thing internally (the reshapes won't actually move any data around). If you *do* want a 3d interpolation, there are tools like tfg.math.interpolation.trilinear.  I don't think it's common enough that we would put it into core tensorflow."," Thanks for your details answer. I did a pause of a project that raised such above issue. I will revisit the problem soon. But below are some quick queries.  1. > A generalized 3D image resize primitive would mirror this, and apply the interpolation/convolution in all 3 dimensions.  Is this https://www.tensorflow.org/graphics/api_docs/python/tfg/math/interpolation/trilinear/interpolate function doing a similar operation? Is it possible to show an example with code? 2. > I don't think it's common enough that we would put it into core tensorflow. Agree. But IMHO, general interpolation methods should be available from core tensorflow.  3. > In MR images, the zdirection usually has a much lower resolution than the others, and the correlation between slices is much lower (since slices have further separation and have larger ""thickness""). You often don't want to interpolate between these. Could you please elaborate on this? 4. > Our `tf.image` toolbox is designed for 2D images and does an interpolation or convolution (depending on the supplied method).  My main approach was not with `tf.image` though, I wanted to use `tf.keras.backend.resize_volumes`, which meant for the volumetric data. Now, unable to downsampling with it was a bit disappointing. To address this is the actual feature request.  In `scipy` and `pytorch`, I can do   Now, if I reform my query, like, how can I achieve this with core `tensorflow`. The `layers.UpSampling3D` which uses `tf.keras.backend.resize_volumes` in backed lacks interpolation methods for 3D volumetric data.",I want to add 3 extra points:   I suppose that `tf.keras.backend` namespace has not a so great planning future right?   Is TF graphics actively maintained/staffed? As we had a quite cyclic activity flow on that repository https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics/issues/340issuecomment708611214      oss  More in general I think it would be more great if we could tell to the TF ecosystem community if we want to separate CV 2d stuffs in Kerascv and CV 3d stuff in TF graphics (if it is actively maintained).,"  1. I have no direct experience with tfg, but you can check out the source for `trilinear` here.  It looks like you give it a set of sampling points (e.g. your desired locations within the new interpolated grid), and it will use trilinear interpolation to extract values at those points. 2. Interpolation is usually viewed as an input preprocessing stage.  It's not *really* part of the ML model.  For 2D images, it is very common to have training images of different sizes (e.g. a collection of downloaded pictures of horses).  And in model serving, if you want a generic inference model that can work for multiple camera resolutions, it makes sense to have a builtin tool to allow these to be resampled to a fixed input size.  3D images, however, are a lot more rare  the most common being medical images.  It is more likely that these will already be of identical size, and if not, you can use whatever tool you need to reinterpolate them ahead of time; it's unlikely you will have a steady stream of 3D images coming directly from a camera, for example.  Similarly with general ND inputs  it's also not as common to need to interpolate onthefly. 3. Interpolation works well when nearby pixels/voxels are highly correlated, so that the new interpolated pixel/voxel is highly representative of those around it.  In MR slices, the slice direction is often separated by larger gaps, the signal is an estimated average over the slice thickness, and it is often captured at a slightly different time than other slices.  For CT it depends on how it's collected.  Many applications also use slices of 2D CT, so you will have similar issues.  Hence there is often a much lower image resolution in the slice direction, and more variation between slices.  In medical applications we often want to keep all slices (at least those in the region of interest). 4. It looks like `resize_volumes` just repeats values along each spatial axis.  The inverse of this is `tf.strided_slice`.  If you have an input of fixed known size, and you just want to decrease the resolution to make the model run faster, it's much more common to add convolution+pooling layers (e.g. `Conv3d` + `MaxPool3d`).  The convolution will try to pick out ""features"", and the pooling will keep only the ""important"" ones while cutting down the number of samples.  That way you're not throwing away any potentially important information. If you just want to cut down the resolution of your fixedsize input images, you could try `tf.nn.avg_pool3d`, which will take the average of a collection of voxels.  This will be similar in nature to trilinear interpolation on a regular grid (and equivalent if you're cutting each dimension down by half), but is already builtin and will be much faster."," not by Google, it's communitydriven.  The interpolate function is pythononly though, and they just use exising `tf` functions underthehood.","> The interpolate function is pythononly though, and they just use exising tf functions underthehood.

Those two accuracy should match.","Hello ,  To answer your questions: 1. On the server, I'm using the Training Set of the fashion MNIST to train the model.

I have done some tests with several input images and apparently those accuracy values do not match. I made sure to load the checkpoint file with restore signature before running the inference. Here is a log of the results:  **On the server:**  **On the mobile :** ","Hi, Could you update your colab notebook to better reproduce this issue? For the current issue, I think there might be some issues when the interpreter reloads the checkpoint so you are not seeing consistent predictions. For the ondevice part, you can still run it in colab. Instead of using C++ interpreter APIs, you can use the python API. So I guess the next steps will be: 1) Train the model for a few epochs 2) Write to a checkpoint 3) Convert to tflite model 4) Make a prediction using the TF model. Compare that with the tflite model (After running restore signature) If the two results don't agree, I think we need to debug what happens during checkpoint reloading.","Hi , I tried to update the Colab Notebook as you suggested. Here is a Gist. I haven't been able to run the restore signature on google Colab, It keeps crashing with an error **AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'shape'**. I guess I'm not giving the correct input to the interpreter.  Anyway, I commented those 2 lines and ran my inference with **NO CHECKPOINT FILE LOADED** and the surprise was that the predictions were exactly the same for the 4 input images as in the inferences using the TF Model. The test procedure is well explained in the Google Colab Gist I shared. Another point, I performed another test ondevice by computing prediction of inference by: 1. Running inference ondevice by calling restore signature to load checkpoint file. 2. Then running inference ondevice without calling restore signature, (I generated a new bin of course) => In both cases, I get the exact same predictions probabilities ... Weird ... Which makes me join you in the idea that something might be wrong with the checkpoint weights loading in the interpreter. ",> It keeps crashing with an error AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'shape'. I guess I'm not giving the correct input to the interpreter. I think you need to construct a string using numpy. Something like (an example) ,"Thank you for your answe , This seems to be doing the trick.    Here is an updated Google Colab Gist. This gets more interesting, it seems that the predictions are still the same between the 3 benchmarking subtests: 1. Running inference using the TF Model 2. Running inference using the TFLite Model without loading checkpoints, (I ran this one before the next one) 3. Running inference using the TFLite Model while loading checkpoints.",",  Any updates on the subject please ? From my side, I wrote a simple application with the same model that loads the checkpoint file with the restore signature, run inference on the Test Set of the Fashion MNIST Dataset (10k Images) and compute the average accuracy based on the predictions, at this stage I get 87% of images predicted correctly. I trained then the same model with the same Dataset for just 5 epochs and ran another batchinferencing on the same Dataset, I got 85% of images predicted well. I didn't call the save and restore signature again since I'm using the same interpreter from the starting of the program.

In the training process, output continues to appear as ""nan"", so could you share the C++ code if you don't mind?"," Okay, looking forward to it, thank you !  if you're output continues to appear as ""nan"", it simply means that you're not feeding your training signature runner with correct data. My source code has been shared at the first comment of this issue. Maybe if you share yours, I could help you identify the root cause of your problem. "," Thank you for your Response. i'm conducting Test Based on the code you shared, and the output still ""Nan"" my Testing Environment  OS : Ubuntu 20.04  Tensorflow : v2.8  Bazel : 4.2.1  build command  : bazel build config=monolithic config=noaws config=nogcp config=nohdfs config=nonccl fat_apk_cpu=x86_64 experimental_ui_max_stdouterr=1073741819 c opt cxxopt=std=c++14 //tensorflow/lite:libtensorflowlite.so with same DataSet and tensorflow exmaple model  do you think OS Difference can cause ""nan"" output  as i know ubuntu and raspberry pi both little Endian","Hello , I have just rerun my code on a Ubuntu 20.04 based system and I'm not getting these ""nan"" output, I get actual loss values, I don't think it's a little Endian issue because in my code I test whether the system is Little Endian before applying the reverse function. I suggest that you add some debugging traces on **fpixels** and **labels** variables to check if your input is correctly fed to the signature function.   Any updates on the restore function eventual bug ?","Hi   Yes. Let me reply separately: >I trained then the same model with the same Dataset for just 5 epochs and ran another batchinferencing on the same Dataset, I got 85% of images predicted well It seems that the model is overfitting. Did you witness loss is continuing dropping in the 5 epochs? > Here is an updated Google Colab Gist. This gets more interesting, it seems that the predictions are still the same between the 3 benchmarking subtests: 1) Running inference using the TF Model 2)Running inference using the TFLite Model without loading checkpoints, (I ran this one before the next one) 3)Running inference using the TFLite Model while loading checkpoints. The reason that 2) gives you the same prediction result is that, the converted TF Lite model has a special op called `CallOnce`, and this op will automatically run a subgraph which initializes the variables with the value at model export time. This is why you get same prediction without loading checkpoint at front. !image I updated your colab, adding a section which continues TF Lite training for 10 more epochs. And I do see the loss dropping from the previous servertrained baseline. I used TF to train 10 epochs initially, with losses: Finished 2 epochs   loss: 0.230 Finished 4 epochs   loss: 0.168 Finished 6 epochs   loss: 0.131 Finished 8 epochs   loss: 0.119 Finished 10 epochs   loss: 0.117 And with TF. Lite, training another 10 epochs, losses: Finished 2 epochs   loss: 0.114 Finished 4 epochs   loss: 0.114 Finished 6 epochs   loss: 0.114 Finished 8 epochs   loss: 0.106 Finished 10 epochs   loss: 0.106 As you see here, the TF Lite loss continue dropping. I think in your original colab, you are training TF for 100 epochs, this will probably lead to overfitting. The only change I made here is to reduce the TF training to 10 epochs, and batch_size = 10.  See the updated colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AabhKW_qCW_UER8NzR9ehoohErCZCcrc?usp=sharing Cheers.","Hello ,  Thank you for your feedback, it was really helpful and I managed to reproduce it on the updated colab you sent. I have been able to see the loss values decreasing continuously from the initial training to the ondevicetraining. Although, I haven't been able to reproduce this behavior ondevice using C++ code. I'm still noticing decreasing but too low values of the loss function, which seems illogical to me. The only code difference between the python script from google Colab and my C++ minimalist application is the dataloader. In Python, we can use the **tf.Dataset.from _tensor_slices()** function, whereas in the C++ application the data is fed manually to the train signature input tensor as follow:  This example has been written based on my analysis and understanding of the signature features from Tensorflow 2.9 source code, so I might be mistaken. Do you have any working C++ code example that will help me reproduce the same issue as in python script ? Thank you for your help and support,","For a given image/label input pair, have you checked whether the floating numbers are the same between the C++ code and the python colab? Let's ensure the input x/y in your C++ code is consistent with the colab.","Hello ,  The input pair was consistent with google's colab input but only for the first epoch. I just figured out what was the problem. In my code, when I read the bytes from the dataset file, I forget to reset the reading position in the second epoch so it keeps training the model with zero arrays for the second and third epochs and that what causes the accuracy dropping. My bad, it was an inattention mistake.  Thank you for this interesting exchange, It helped me understand a lot about this ondevicetraining feature, I will close the issue. ",Great that you solved the issue!,"I found this feature very interesting, too bad there isn't any detailed documentation on the topic. I'm ready to contribute on the topic if needed. Although, I still have some optional questions, I'm trying to leverage the use case to a more realistic one (Image classification using MobileNet Models). I have found this example using Tranfer Learning on android. What took my attention is that they are adding a new signature for loading the bottleneck features and a train signature that fine tunes only the classifier (the last FC layers). My questions are: Is it possible to retrain the convolutional layers ondevice ? Or the ondevicetraining supports only the FC layers for now ?  If it is possible can you provide any example on how to that ? Would **model.fit()** function work on device by calling the TensorFlow Eager executor ? Thank you again for your valuable support."

The passes themselves are standard MLIR ones and you seem like you know that part (the ops I can point you to their definitions in either dialect too).  tfopt is more of a testing tool, so the UI is more basic/sharp edges but it's fairly simple to add a pass. There isn't a registration mechanism to add a pass beyond just modifying it to register your pass and changing the BUILD file (alternatively one can just create a new fooopt tool and register the dialects and passes one want/copy those from tfopt and add new ones, this should be possible wherever you can add bazel dep).

However, the trick lies during the instantiation phase. That is if and only if the typename could be found with detailed declaration, otherwise it will fail. OK, back to the instantiation phase of our case:  check the implementation of https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.hL375  how does TensorShapeProto generate? it is a sort of proto file (protobuf protocol declaration) which will be converted to pb.h file together with its default implementation based on protobuf protocol.

Instead, if you need to use features implemented in custom ops, you have to import the corresponding package. In most cases this is done via the side effect of an import. Even if you don't use the imported name anywhere else in your code, the import also results in loading shared objects in the C++ runtime, some of which objects are just implementations of these kernels. This way, users that don't care about these custom ops (because their code doesn't use that) are not impacted and all other users can use these ops by just adding one single import or a minimal amount of code changes. This is similar to how we now have the cloud filesystem support: you would import tensorflow_io and get access to reading files from these filesystems, with minimal changes to your code."," makes sense, thank you!

Python binding actually uses the C++ implementation of Tensorflow Lite. Considering the Python runtime overhead itself, I would expect, under the same running environment, the Python performance should be no better than that of the C++ one. 2. Linear scaling w/ threads isn't guaranteed at all in practice due to various factors. For example, if some TFLite op in the graph isn't parallelized, then running with multiple threads on the op doesn't help at all. In addition, the multithreading performance could suffer if there's resource contention on CPU cores. Btw, you could use the TFLite benchmark tool to measure the performance of your model.

Lastly, regarding the intriguing performance difference reported here, after looking at the additional details you've provided, I'm now thinking whether it could be caused by the compiler or not as there's a performancedifference issue before that's solved by upgrading the compiler to gcc 9.0+ (you used gcc 8.3 here in this case?).   My guess is based on the assumption that you compiled the C++ lib/binary from source while using the Python library from the official TF 2.8.0 release. To help validate the guess, could you try the following (from being easy to being complex): * Download the prebuilt latest linux_x8664 benchmark binary to benchmark the detect model and check whether there are performance differences? More options for the benchmark tool could be found here. * As your model is a quantized model (uint8), could you try run with the corresponding nonquantized fp32 model? Just wondering the performance difference also occurs with the fp32 model. * Also build the TFLite python library from source using the same building env? Or use the TF dev/nightly docker (which includes newer compilers) to build the lib/binary? Again, many thanks for reporting the issue and the detailed description earlier!","label_image (C ++) doesn't seem to have xnnpack delegate enabled. You must specify the `xnnpack_delegate` option.

To summarize, these series of commands should be able to reproduce the error: ","I found the problem, but it wasn't caused by me. In my PR, line 76 correctly uses the `CHECK` macro. But somehow, when committing, the TensorFlow gardener decided to change the `CHECK` for a `DCHECK` on line 76, which obviously gets removed in release builds. And when we look at the git blame, we see that all lines are attributed to me, except for that infamous `CHECK` line. What could cause this behavior? Is there a script that converts `CHECK` statements to `DCHECK` for performance purposes and it erroneously changed this line, or is there something I have to do to force it to not be removed? I created a brand new PR where I replaced the `CHECK` statement with an `OP_REQUIRES` statement, but I'd still like to understand why the `CHECK` seems to have magically been replaced with a `DCHECK`.","`CHECK`s have been causing issues in the past and are discouraged (there is automation that blocks submit with them, unless there are additional steps taken). `DCHECK` is a workaround with some differences `OP_REQUIRES` is the best approach to use.","It would have been fine if the submission had been blocked, but the automation silently changing `CHECK` to `DCHECK` can be hard to debug when the change gets reverted, especially when refactoring old code that already contained them.","It wasn't automation, it was a deliberate change during PR import.","Sorry for the late reply and thank you for looking into it!

Can you please share the model along with code containing representative dataset to replicate the issue? I was going to propose these changes for integer quantization.  Thanks! ,"The actual model is quite complicated, but I could implement a shorter example: ",Ok  ! I used tf.lite.interpreter from version 2.8 instead of tflite.interpreter from tflite_runtime. Attaching resolved gist for reference. Thanks!,"Thanks, it is working for me with `tf.lite` instead of `tflite_runtime` and `v=2.8` as well. (I kept float32 input and output) Do you know when `tflite_runtime=2.8` will be released? My target is a RaspberryPi and using the full tensorflow installation isn't really feasible.","I also tried the export with the full model, which is working too, but the outputs are now incorrect.  Instead of predicting some text the model now only predicts _blank_ labels (normally the most common label), so it returns an empty text... There was no problem with the default quantization approach without the representative dataset (I tried different sizes between 20 and 2000 samples, resulting in slight changes of the softmax output, but no real changes of the argmax label). Do you have an idea about this? Is it common that _int8_ quantization can break the model?"," ! Regarding the Raspberry pi deployment and tflite_run_time 2.8 , You can check this repo. Can you check the wave to spectrogram  part of document mentioned in these documents 1 , 2 for debugging the prediction part? ","I think I could solve my problem with the full model. For melspectrogram and featurenormalization I'm adding very small values to the tensors to prevent _log_ and _div_ with zero, but with the _int8quantization_ those ""zeroguards"" are just set to zero themselves, so I'm getting _nan_ values inbetween... Do you know the smallest value I can use? Currently I'm using `2**5`, and `2**6` was to small. Thanks for the tip to the spectrogram debugging documents. You can find my complete debugging script here: https://gitlab.com/DANBER/Scribosermo//blob/cfc/extras/misc/complex_tflite_test.py Regarding the version problem, it seems that _2.8_ is only required for exporting. I also found that, presumably only in the case of the example script, using a larger number (>= 100) of representative examples decreases the performance of quantization. I think the effect could be smaller if there is a real model after the feature calculation. What do you think about this?"," ! Glad you sorted out the issue .  Try with ""1.001e5"" as the minimum value to avoid zero division error.  You can batch the data in the representative dataset if you are worried about performance( which seems to be implemented already in gitlab link). Please move this to closed status if it worked. Thanks!",This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has no recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you.,"The smallest value working as zeroguard for `log` was `2 ** 5`, smaller values sometimes resulted in `inf` results. The smallest value for `div` was `1/255`, smaller values sometimes resulted in `nan` results.

SaveableObject.restore called under tf.init_scope: train_function > step_function > train_step > optimizer.minimize > apply_gradients > tf.init_scope > optimizer._create_all_weights > _create_slots > add_slot > _restore_slot_variable > restore. There are two problems with tf.init_scope: 1) ReplicaContext.replica_id_in_sync_group is unusable. Attempt to use it leads to an error ""TypeError:  is out of scope and cannot be used here. Use return values, explicit Python locals or TensorFlow collections to access it."".

About (2), because `copy_gradient`'s first return value isn't used, `var_up` in `grad` will also be zeros. I can't think of a working workaround though.

One of the key features of TensorFlow is its ability to create custom gradients for differentiable functions. In this article, we will explore the concept of upstream gradient of variables in tf.custom_gradient and how it can impact the performance of machine learning models. When working with machine learning models, it is important to understand the concept of gradients. Gradients are used to optimize the weights and biases of a model by minimizing the loss function. TensorFlow provides a mechanism for creating custom gradients using the tf.custom_gradient function. This function allows users to define their own gradients for a given function.","Hi, Thank you for opening this issue.

Could you please look at this issue? It's replicating in 2.7 , 2.8 and nightly. ","It looks like this discrepancy is due to the fact that TensorFlow uses the fast inverse DCT by default for decoding JPEG images. However, this fact is completely opaque to someone using `tf.image.adjust_jpeg_quality`. I was able to reproduce the wrong output tensor by running libjpegturbo's `djpeg dct fast` command. I see two options to solve this issue: 1. Use the accurate integer DCT by default. 2. Provide an argument to choose the DCT method in `tf.image.adjust_jpeg_quality` or at least mention this caveat in the method's documentation. Besides from that, it is very unsatisfactory that the example provided with `tf.image.adjust_jpeg_quality` uses a float tensor with values above 1, although `convert_image_dtype` states that float tensors are expected to have values in the range \[0, 1).","On a side note, it also seems inconsistent to me that TensorFlow uses the accurate DCT (JDCT_ISLOW) for JPEG compression and the inaccurate IDCT (JDCT_IFAST) for decompression by default.",> Provide an argument to choose the DCT method in tf.image.adjust_jpeg_quality Do you have any interest in contributing a PR for this? > at least mention this caveat in the method's documentation.

Could you check this resolved gist? Thanks!,"Yes, this works around the problem in my simplified repro. And I see that the relevant difference is that you removed ""[0,0]"" from the code. I found that changing it to ""[0]"" also seems to work around the problem. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble fixing my larger project because I don't understand what specific condition triggers this problem. Is it inappropriate to index a tensor all the way down to a scalar inside of gradient tape? I tried auditing each variable in model.trainable_variables to make sure there are no scalars, but the problem still persists. Is it possible to articulate what I did wrong?","Hi  ! I have used [0,0] to instantiate the MyModel class in this line. `model = MyModel([0,0])` then model(x) instead of `theta = model(x)[0,0]` Attaching relevant thread for reference. 1, 2. Thank you!","Yes, I can follow the recommended structure better. Sorry. I have fixed my code to do that. But this is not relevant to the bug. This example does not throw any exceptions:  But this example does throw an exception:  The only difference is the first (working) example uses ""model(x)[0]"" and the second (broken) example uses ""model(x)[0,0]"". My question is, why does the second (broken) example throw an exception that says ""ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero""? I did not do an integer division or modulo. I only indexed an element in a tensor.",Hi ! Could you please look at this issue ? Attaching Gist for reference.,",  Loss calculation was concatenating a bunch of scalars together, by changing them from scalars to rank 1 tensors with keep_dims, the error no longer occurs.  Since `tf.concat()` doesn’t have keepdims argument, replace it with `tf.math.reduce_mean().` Thanks!","Yes, that fixes it. Thanks so much!

Thx for reporting this! This is not surprising to us when we turned on XNNPACK by default, especially when the model is small and the relative memory footprint increase is quite large. We intentionally made a tradeoff between memory consumption increase and performance gains across a wide range of platforms.  Note we provide multiple options to disable using XNNPACKbydefault if the memory consumption increase doesn't fit your use cases. One could use any one of the following options: 1. Add define=tflite_with_xnnpack=false when compiling the code using Bazel. 2. In C++ code, use BuiltinOpResolverWithoutDefaultDelegates when resolving Tensorflow Lite ops. 3.

The issue of copying back into readonly memory regions indeed is resolved as  pointed out here https://github.com/tensorflow/tflitemicro/issues/903. 2. The overall main problem of unnecessary copying of readonly tensors is not resolved and still exists.

After that, I try to convert them with different TF version. So far, some models on Hexagon still have wrong value on different version of tensorflow, but all fine on CPU. I can reproduce this bug using TFLite converter in Tensorflow 2.4.0 2.5.0, 2.6.0, 2.7.0, 2.8.0, 2.9.1.  Troubleshooting In our case, some building block, e.g. the residuallike conv. building block, may cause ***standalone ReLU*** operator in TFLite. When this kind of operators occurs in graph, the results on CPU and Hexagon are usually different. For example, this kind of building block result in wrong value in Hexagon. !image  Consistent results on TF 2.2 I also find that using converter in Tensorflow 2.2.0 get correct result on both CPU and Hexagon.","Hi, Thank you for opening this issue.

When I installed CUDA 11.1, which is usually bundled with cuDNN 8.0.x, TensorFlow threw an error saying it requires cuDNN 8.1.x. Hence, upgrading cuDNN to 8.1.1 does the trick.

Furthermore, running these codes has not used more than 1GB of GPU memory.  !image **Doesn't have enough compute capacity** From the code block above, you can see that the compute capability is 7.5. Is this not enough? **There's a driver issue.** I can reproduce this on any of the AWS's AMI with GPU and CUDA 11.2.1 installed. Similarly, I can reproduce this on my local machine with Geforce RTX 3060 which has compute capability of 8.6 where the NVIDIA driver, CUDA 11.2.1 and cuDNN 8.1 are freshly installed. However, I don't see this issue on any of AWS's AMI with CUDA 11.1.1 installed after upgrading cuDNN to version 8.1 (from version 8.0)  I observe the same behaviour when installing CUDA 11.1.1 and cuDNN 8.1 on my local machine with Geforce RTX 3060.

To answer the last quest:    (1) all conv/innerproduct (matmul fused)/matmul (sgemm) ops will be cached at TF    (2) scratchpad buffer is allocated with Compute(), just before invoking oneDNN execution.

The buffer size is decided by oneDNN. Please check the ""struct UserScratchPad"" implementation in core/util/mkl_util.h  Thank you for the quick reply! I understand that the user scratchpad is allocated in `Compute()`. But I don't understand how this differs from letting oneDNN allocate the buffer itself, since the matmul primitive here is not cached in LRU and is created every time `Compute()` is called too (and oneDNN allocates memory at primitive creation time). Both approaches seem to allocate scratchpad memory with similar lifetime, and the sizes shouldn't be too different since the userallocated approach also gets the size from oneDNN. So I'm wondering what makes the difference here (in this PR).","  When user scratch pad is not used by framework, oneDNN primitive adds its own scratch pad and hold it as long as the primitive is alive. TF also keeps all primitives alive till the LRU cache is full. In cases where there are many threads, each thread can create primitives for same dimensions, since the cache is thread local (this is essential). This results is many (similar) primitives created across multiple threads. For example, in the case of transformer (for which the issue was reported), the matmul dimensions varies based on input. This results in 100s of primitives getting created in each thread (when the thread count is greater than 1), each holding its scratch pad mem alive. And transformer with greater than 4 threads was going out of memory in machines with less memory (<182 GB)   With UserScratchPad, the TF framework controls the scratchpad by creating and releasing the scratchpad memory as needed : ie (as of now) create it before execution and release it after execution of the primitive. This keeps the memory consumption low for the entire model"

It seems that the PyPI packages for Tensorflow are being deliberately blocked for use on MSYS2 somehow, and I'm not sure if that's deliberate (nothing in the documentation that I could see) or on purpose (would be nice to know the reason).","Further to the above, I note that I typed `python3 m pip debug verbose` and got the following output:  Meanwhile, if I type ` python3 m pip download tensorflow platform win32 pythonversion 3.9 vv nodeps` then I get this output:  Which clearly indicates that it is the 'platform tag' that is causing the problem here. In short, `cp39cp39win_amd64` doesn't match with `cp39cp39mingw_x86_64`.  The question is, does the platform need to be so restrictive here? If Python/Wheel wasn't blocking me, would this module actually work, or not? Is this a MSYS2 issue or a TensorFlow issue, I wonder? https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0425/platformtag","One more thing. If I manually unzip the .whl file  and then 'trick' Python into importing that package:  I opened `_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.pyd` using Dependency Walker, and found that the file that was missing was `PYTHON39.DLL`. On MinGW64, this file is called `libpython3.9.dll`, so I made a copy of the MinGW64 file, and renamed it to the expected name `python39.dll`. I then made a tiny bit more progress, namely:  This looks like it's getting a little bit further, and attempting to `dlopen` some CUDArelated stuff, and my system doesn't have CUDA, so I guess it fails. But presumably, it should not be crashing out of Python in this case. All in all, it looks like the `mingw_x86_64` 'platform tag' makes sense, because the DLL for Python has a different name on this platform compared to `win_amd64`, and that means that platformsensitive Python modules need to be compiled differently on this platform.  Having established that, are there any suggestions for how to compile Tensorflow such that it works with the MSYS2MinGW64 version of Python?"," , Can you please take a look at this link for the issue with the similar DLL error.It helps.Thanks!","Hi Tilakrayal  thanks for the link. However, my comments above were basically ""deep hacking"" of the available TensorFlow PyPI package to try to identify why it was refusing to install. It obviously still refuses to install on MSYS2, and our first need here is to figure out why that is, and then secondly, assuming that's correct, to figure out how to install it otherwise. I think that the issue is that MSYS2 doesn't support CUDA (AFAICT) and that, hence, the TensforFlow build process basically doesn't use the MSYS2 compiler, and tries to mostly not use MSYS2 at all, except for some bash tricks perhaps. I don't actually want/need CUDA for my application, so this is annoying for me, but I do understand. Our only path forward seems to be to attempt to install Windows Python, then install TensorFlow with the `pip` from Windows Python, then compile our local codebase against Windows Python instead of MinGW64 Python.","Hi  , The prebuilt binaries for windows are of win_amd64.whl type and seems not supporting for mingw_x86_64 architecture. You have option for Build from source using MSYS shell. Please refer to the documentation here for same. May be this can be helpful for your case. Please check and confirm if this solves your purpose. Thank you!","Hi , Thanks for the documentation link. It says that one can build using the MSYS2 bash shell. But would this produce a version of Tensorflow that is built using MINGW's GCC and links to the MINGW version of Python?  The instructions say to use the MSYS2 shell, but then all of the instructions for installing dependencies, specifically MS Visual C++ Build Tools, etc. (ie ""then follow the previous instructions for the Windows native command line""). I feel that the instructions are not really sufficiently clear. For example, if using MSYS2, and I want to use the MSYS2 version of Python, why would I install Windows Python? It would be helpful to have an endtoend set of instructions for building on MSYS2, using native MSYS2 GCC and Python, etc.  It would be even better if PyPI could host the resulting packages ;) But as noted, there may be issues with CUDA support in MSYS2 (not a big deal for me, but certainly it would be for others).","I'm in a similar situation. I need to adapt an open source application that was build under Windows using MYSYS2. Now we want to add a tensorflow model to the application. Two things are now bothering us. First tensorflow doesn't work under MYSYS2 (at least we can't get it to build/work). Secondly, From Tensorflow 2.11 GPU support is only under WSL2, but not anymore under Windows directly. GPU accelerated computing is really crucial.",Most likely this should be closed as duplicate of CC(Help! I have an issue when importing TF!) ,Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?

I can confirm you that it is reproduceable on both armv8 and armv7 architectures. Thank you in advance,","Hello  ,    I'm doubting this is isn't a bug but more of a missing feature. I have tried an interesting experimentation, I tried running the same script on my x86 host machine with no tensorflow package installed, only the tfliteruntime Python pip_package installed, this reproduces the same issue. After installing Tensorflow package, the error traces disappear. This made me think about some operation features missing in the interpreter I build using CMake. I was trying to add debug some traces into the tensorflow source code to be able to figure it out. I have reached some conclusions:  The traces I added were mainly near the intepreter function and allowed me to notice that the FlexReluGrad had no prepare function as you may notice below:    Based on the documentation, in order to do ondevicetraining, it is necessary to add the **Flex Delegate** to the interpreter during the build and select some tensorflow ops so the FlexOps could be understood by the interpreter (Hence the error, I'm getting each time : **_Node number 54 (FlexReluGrad) failed to prepare._**   By getting a closer look inside the libtensorflowlite.a generated by  CMake, I can see that none of the flex delegate function has been integrated in the build since the variable TFLITE_DELEGATES_FLEX_SRCS is empty.  By digging deeper inside the Bazel BUILD scripts, I was trying to duplicate the same build dependencies and sources to build using CMake. I have also noticed that many dependencies from tensorflow/core/framework are used. => To make it short, I'm trying to build a shared library containing the flex delegates with the _with_select_tf_ops=true_ but using **Cmake** instead of **Bazel** since it's not an option for me. This may be pushed as a new feature in the tensorflow/lite/CMakeList.txt  upon completion, so I'm looking for some guidance on the dependencies and sources to build for that purpose. ", triaging for ondevice related issues.,"Hi, Sorry for the late reply. ReluGrad isn't a supported builtin op of TF Lite. So you will need to link in the Flex delegate to make it able to run ondevice.","Hello ,  First of all, thank you for your reply. That's what I figured out, then I tried to build a new libtensorflowliteflex.so library with the Flex Delegates and the necessary TF Ops kernels (ReluOp, SaveOp and RestoreOp in this case) using SELECTIVE_REGISTRATION Mode, but the build does not seem to be working properly for aarch64 as stated in this issue. Also, do you have a clearer example on how to link the flex delegate to my interpreter ? I tried doing this :   For now, I cannot tell if it is working properly or not because I still don't have a properly working shared library libtensorflowliteflex.so to link against. Thank you for your support, Othmane",Will https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/52018 help you resolve the build issue?,"Hello ,  Sorry, I was mistaken in the link of the issue. The one I mentioned was actually closed and the CC(libtensorflowlite target compilation failed) did help, hence it was closed.

Thank you!," Thank you for solving the bug with commit d088d70cc655a16360bd7926db3fe2842414255b With `use_bias = True` things are coherent now, an int32 accumulator is used with an int32 bias and an int64 accumulator with an int64 bias. But if `use_bias = False` is used, an int32 accumulator will be used in all cases, is it intentional? I would expect that setting `converter._experimental_full_integer_quantization_bias_type` to `tf.int64` or `None` would enable the usage of an int64 accumulator in all cases as even if an int16x8 layer has no bias, there's still a high risk of overflow with an int32 accumulator. It also changes the default numerical behaviour of the reference kernel, before an int16x8 FC layer without a bias would have an int64 accumulator but now an int32 one is used even if `converter._experimental_full_integer_quantization_bias_type` is not set to `tf.int32`.", I wonder whether you're interested in providing a fix for this case.,"I don't have much time to work on it for now but I may be looking to do it in a couple of weeks/months if you don't have to time to pick it up on your side. The main difficulty is that we may need to record the bias type (and thus implicitly the accumulator type) in the layer FlatBuffer options. Currently TFL uses the bias type to decide the accumulator type but it falls apart when the layer has no bias. If a model was created with `converter._experimental_full_integer_quantization_bias_type=tf.int64 or None` then an int64 accumulator should be used, even for layer without any bias, otherwise an int32 accumulator must be used if `tf.int32` was set in the flag. Edit: Though it seems having a bias tensor (even if all zeros) is enforced for the CONV operator (see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/kernels/conv.ccL385). We could do the same for the other operators eventually.",One fundamental question: do we really want accumulators to be 32bits?  16 bits activation X 8 bits weights FC means that the maximum dimension we can have before integer overflow is 2^8 = 256. ,"> One fundamental question: do we really want accumulators to be 32bits? 16 bits activation X 8 bits weights FC means that the maximum dimension we can have before integer overflow is 2^8 = 256. I think that was considered when Dayeong added this feature at the first place. That is why we set the 64bit as the default to avoid overflowing. Users will need to check the accuray by themselves and set the `_experimental_full_integer_quantization_bias_type` if it works for them. From the description of that change: ""For 16x8 Quant, the default is to store the bias as 64 bit. However, 64 bit is 1.5~2 times slower than 32 bits so there is a feature request to enable 32 bit bias in 16x8 Quant. Users can test their model's accuracy and performance with both 32 bit and 64 bit and finalize which options to go by themselves. The default is {32bit for int8Quant, 64bit for int16Quant}.""","Understood. However, it it possible to have 64 bits accumulator but 32 bits bias?

My Model parameters means, after model.summary() in Tensorflow, it shows model architecture and below to it prints abput parameter..say..trainable parameters, nontrainable parameters. What is these trainable parameters, nontrainable parameters? Is it models neurons information?","Generally, what the `model.summary()` shows the architecture of the model. Like how many dense blocks u have used, how many convolutional blocks u have used etc. At the very end you will see that there is written about this much `trainable param` and this much `nontrainable` parameters. Trainable parameters are those parameters, which will be updated over time, during the time of back propagation. If you know that the hidden neurons, which we set in the dense layers, are nothing but some sort of `weight` matrix. The weights (elements of that matrix) are the trainable parameters. At the same time, suppose nontrainable params are those, which are not updated over time. Some of them are `Dropout layer`, `MaxPool layer` etc. As these parameters do not provide a learnable paradigm in the models. So this combination of trainable and nontrainable parameters, both constitutes as parameters of the model, and that whole information of that model architecture is being provided by the summary.  Also, fun fact, Do not get confused with hyperparameter, and nontrainable parameter. Hyper parameter are some sort of user defined values, which are tweakable and are set to the models. Like the number of hidden neurons in layers, the learning rate, the value of `p` in dropout etc. Non trainable parameters originates from the model, and have some dependency of set up of hyper parameters. Like suppose in case of dropout layer, the value of p. Or the strides taken in maxpool etc.  Go through this link, to have more indepth understanding of trainable and nontrainable parameters.

This was not straight forward due to two things. First there is a range of commits that will not build in the period of interest which may be affecting the result. Secondly the signature of the problem changes at some point from 'free of invalid pointer and abort' to segfault. The result of the bisect was https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/367cf9968c3d14d9d41d1775d8ceeb8e7bf3190f which introduces cpu_feature_guard. However if I remove the call to that .so from the latest git HEAD, the build still fails.",I used git bisect to isolate the point where the signature of the failure changed from segfault to abort. The result was this commit about protobuf https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7fbc5be3b5a3cc17c05f1ae5b0577fdca8a0e0e2,If I go back to https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/367cf9968c3d14d9d41d1775d8ceeb8e7bf3190f where the segfault first appeared and cherry pick https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7fbc5be3b5a3cc17c05f1ae5b0577fdca8a0e0e2 then the segfault turns into the abort.,If I go back to https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/098fc5e8c58ed0582cd0121839cddbff0a1c89d5 which is the commit before https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/367cf9968c3d14d9d41d1775d8ceeb8e7bf3190f the build works. But if I then cherry pick https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7fbc5be3b5a3cc17c05f1ae5b0577fdca8a0e0e2 it results in the abort. So I think this shows that protobuf is definitely implicated in the abort.,"Moving now to git HEAD, if I revert the change from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7fbc5be3b5a3cc17c05f1ae5b0577fdca8a0e0e2 the failure changes from abort to segfault. Furthermore if I remove the call to _cpu_feature_guard.so from tensorflow/python/platform/self_check.py which effectively undoes the change from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/367cf9968c3d14d9d41d1775d8ceeb8e7bf3190f then the build completes successfully. So the segfault and the abort are two separate issues and both need to be addressed.","If I understand correctly, if you revert these two old commits you can build on the latest version of master and not encounter any issues?","Pretty much yes, but not quite so simple as that. There are later commits that build on the use of _cpu_feature_guard.so so simply reverting https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/367cf9968c3d14d9d41d1775d8ceeb8e7bf3190f is not possible which is why I just removed the call from self_check.py. Also https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7fbc5be3b5a3cc17c05f1ae5b0577fdca8a0e0e2 looks to be a bug fix and probably should not be reverted. Running the failure through pdb in both cases the failure happens on this line of python `from tensorflow.python.tools.api.generator import doc_srcs` in tensorflow/python/__init__.py Also latest version of master is broken in an additional way since this morning. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/54273",Tagged the author of the XNNPACK dep on that PR. Will try to get some help on this issue too.,This seems to have been caused by the use of BAZEL_LINKLIBS to add 'l%:stdc++' to the build. This was introduced in our initial CI scripts and has since just been carried forward. I am not sure of the initial need for this usage but it is not needed now.,Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue? Yes No

It's fine to destroy the TfLiteModel object before the lifetime of the TfLiteInterpreter has ended (since internally the TfLiteInterpreter has a shared_ptr to the underlying FlatBufferModel object), it's only the byte buffer whose lifetime needs to last beyond the lifetime of the TfLiteInterpreter.
